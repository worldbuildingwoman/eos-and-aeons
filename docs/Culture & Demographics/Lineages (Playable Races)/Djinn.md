_(Based on the Air Genasi of 5e.)_ 

Djinn are a uniquely powered species that were brought into existence by [[Fortune]]. Generally creatures of good fortune, they bestow such magic on [[The Multiverse - Eos]], in partnership with [[Domain - Reverie]] and helping to see dreams become reality. 

### History

When it comes to war or disagreements between the aeons, it is rare that one will intervene on behalf of another, especially one such as Fortune who believes balance is found in the randomness of the universe. However, the annuls of Oraculum will cite that Dream sought out Fortune’s council after the creation of the [[Devils]] of Ennui. During the conversation, sensing an imbalance in the twins’ perogatives, Fortune showed a rare moment of bias and summoned in the soul of a demon who was due for their next incarnation. Normally, Devils were automatically returned to Ennui, but Fortune used her ability to creatures the first djinn, choosing instead to hone their skill for bargains and deals into divine intervention. Sticking true to her nature of randomness though, the djinn became creatures of the element, air, free to go about as they please and fulfill the wishes of those they deemed worthy. Their gift for fortune however, would be just as free-spirited. 

### Proud Creators

Beings of innate arcane fortune, djinn take immense pride in their work. This can sometimes come off as arrogant or overly confident, as they see themselves and their ancestors as having a pivotal role in the success of the [[Domain - Mundane]] thus far. Failure, although directly tied to the inevitable chance of their abilities, is hard on their pride. Most djinn work tirelessly to improve their abilities in order to impress upon the world their might and counter the unfair bargains in the world. 

### In the Mundane

While in the Mundane, like all other species, djinn appear as the mortal Humans. Their magic, however, remains so as to help find worthy mortals or beings that deserve a chance at their wildest dreams.
 
**Creature Type:** Humanoid 
**Size:** Medium or small 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Ability Score Increase:** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Suggestions would be Wisdom and Constitution. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20. 
**Languages:** You know Common and one other language of your choice. 

**Fortune Intervenes:** A djinn can choose a creature it deems as worthy of a wish, including itself, and offer them a chance at their wildest dreams. To fulfill the wish, roll a percentile die. If you roll equal to or lower than your level, the wish is successful. If you roll equal to or higher than 100 minus your level, the wish backfires is a curse of misfortune on the individual. On a successful wish, you can't use this trait for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. At 20th level, a djinn can cast wish or choose to curse an individual with misfortune, once per 7 days. (Divine Intervention reskinned.) 

**Unending Breath:** You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated. 

**Mingle with the Wind:** You can cast the _levitate_ spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

**Geographic Distribution:** [[Domain - Reverie]]
