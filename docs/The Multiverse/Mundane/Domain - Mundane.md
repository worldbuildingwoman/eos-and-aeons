*Alternative Name(s):* The realm of mortals
*Type:* Dimensional Plane
*Owner/Ruler:*

## Summary

Once said to be gray and lifeless, the Mundane evolved and blossomed on its own and then with the help of the other realms. From its plain earth and nonmagical waters came the mortals, and from their minds, a new understanding of the world. Their existence was both fascinating and puzzling to the Aeons and those in their realms, and some came to favor them more than others. It exists inside the Weave but they have not yet grasped an understanding of it yet. Instead, humans put their stock into invention and science, explaining the natural world through discovery rather than mysticism. Though it is still called the Mundane by the others of the multiverse, it is no longer so plain. It thrives and with its ties to the other realms, so do they.
