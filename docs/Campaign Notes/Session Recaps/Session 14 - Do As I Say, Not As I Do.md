## Summary

The session greeted us with an eerie morning amongst the mists of Despair. The party woke and remained rather quiet as they began to pick up for the day and continue their journey towards the Endless Wastes. Upon approaching the sweltering hot red desert, Xixy reminded everyone to stay quiet, to which Auden attempted to aid them all by casting silence on an item he was carrying and moving it with the party. This worked for the most part, but as they began to move through the canyon, the sound of roars and lightning cracks -- which turned out to actually be some sort of gun shot-- caught their attention as they were dragged into battle with an aberrant giant and two new NPCs. While the party did their best to defeat the giant, the noise of this encounter alerted the real threat - a huge purple worm that could borrow its way through the canyon walls, and packing one hell of a razor-sharp bite. While Morielle tried to draw it away, the war-forged fighter would not let him go alone and when he was swallowed, it drew his companion and then the rest of the party back, going against Morielle's commands. The party did eventually bring the beast down but not before both the warforged and Phinneas were eaten. During all of this, Carmilla remained out of the fight and instead focused on the other beast that was watching them all, the nothic, Lolligag, who gave the Baroness a riddle but remained unaggressive. With the worm slain, the party harvested some of its teeth and acid sacs before turning their attention to the main goal of their quest: the quizzical nothic and his infuriating rhymes.
