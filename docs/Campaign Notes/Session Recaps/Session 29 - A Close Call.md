## Summary

Last session saw the party finishing up a little shopping with their newly acquired riches, in preparation for the mission the following day. They divested Lucky's Bazaar of a number of magical items and scrolls, while suffering a few consequences of their curiosity. Eventually, they made their way back to the Charmed Embrace where Invidious managed to free the soul previously trapped in the Ring of Mind Shielding - a vampirate's lover - where he then ate the soul to absorb its benefits while the rest of the party spent their evening attuning to some of their new items. After a long rest, the party awoke refreshed, with Alina gaining advantage on Athletics, Morielle on Religion, and Phinneas on Performance and Investigation. They ate a quick breakfast before Morielle headed off to pick up his new shortsword of venom and then to meet Niamh at the fountain outside the Jade Palace. After blending into the crowd at the Jade Palace, they witness Lady Fortune for the first time - wearing a different face than Morielle remembers and seemingly much beloved by her people. Many in the crowd had thrown trinkets in her path, in the hopes that they might turn to riches in her wake. The Assembly seems a chore to sit through until a little plasmoid - the one that had been previously seen being escorted out of Ed's office - made his case for a new alliance between the realms of Fortuna and Reverie in the form of a trade route on the rainbows, it's then that Fortune stood and gave an impressive speech about change and throwing away the threads of the past. This caused such a discourse that the party was able to use it as a distraction and snuck out, using their wiles to navigate their way through the palace and to the Hall of Numbers. They're nearly safe but a close call turns into a harrowing experience as the players make it through the heads reciting memories to them and appear on the otherside of the portal. They meet two new individuals in this topsy turvy in-between - R.U.E. and T.I.C. before they are gestured through to the next realm.
