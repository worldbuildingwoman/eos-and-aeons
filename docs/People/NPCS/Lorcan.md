The bastard son of the devil Envy is a gladiator fighting in the pits, known simply as "The Bastard" among his fellow fighters and spectators. He is a striking figure with jet-black hair that falls to his shoulders, sharp features, and eyes that seem to shift color depending on the light. He stands tall and muscular, with scars crisscrossing his skin and tattoos covering his arms.

As the son of Envy, The Bastard is consumed by a never-ending desire for power, wealth, and recognition. He's cunning and ruthless in the pits, always looking for an opportunity to gain an advantage over his opponents. His fighting style is precise and calculated, using his strength and speed to overwhelm his enemies.

Despite his brutal nature, The Bastard is also a master of deception and manipulation. He's known for playing mind games with his opponents and using their weaknesses against them. He's not afraid to resort to dirty tactics if it means winning a fight.

As for his name, The Bastard prefers to go by "Envy's Son" rather than any given name. He wears this title as a badge of honor, embracing his lineage and using it to strike fear into his opponents. To those who know him well, however, he's simply known as "The Bastard" - a name that reflects his brutal nature and his status as an outcast.
