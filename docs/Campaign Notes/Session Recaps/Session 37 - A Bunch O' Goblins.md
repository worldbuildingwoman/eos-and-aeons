## Summary

The party met up with Sol Sandstrife at the Study of Spokes, who had found a trace mention of the keycoin in his research. It wasn't directly named but a similar artifact had been brought up describing a premonition that a Seer made: "*The sleep shifter stirs, for a thing that should not dream has learned to wake. He seeks a key without wards, wrought not for doors but for flesh and thought alike, able to lock even that which has no threshold. When the key is turned in the nameless place of the creature's mind, its waking will be sealed, and it shall fall into an endless sleep from which even aeons will not rouse.*" They also learned it was likely made out of Valiar, a metal that hasn't been around since the Dread Wars. In addition to this, they attempt to look for Caspian's book and realize it's a forgery, which sends Morielle into a state of complaints and the closure of the library for the day. It seems that the librarians had missed this and are extremely disturbed by the revelation. Meanwhile, they stopped by the Crossed Arsenal after getting a note from Aran about SAM. He lets them know he can make a basic chassis for the automaton but if they happen to find the rare valiar on their travels, he might be able to make something even more impressive. With the party back together, they decide that their coin purses are feeling a bit too light for their future travels--and they still don't know how to get back to the Mundane--so they'll be working on jobs while they try and find passage. They opt for defending the new dam, which is being plagued by repeated goblin attacks. Arrival at the dam shows one such attack as in progress, so the party follows them into now dried up ravine. The kill most of the goblins but Oborozuki captures the one who seemed in charge, while three goblins managed to get away.
