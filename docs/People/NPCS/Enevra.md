**Backstory:** Enevra is a siren, born originally in the Nostalgia Sea out of Dream's tears to the royal family of the Idonian Sirens. As a young princess, she was clever but unsatisfied with the life of a singing seductress of Reverie. She followed the currents of Nostalgia into the land of Despair and it was here she found a feeding ground of plenty - and entire domain that desired nothing more than some sliver of happiness or to be put out of their misery for good. 

She spent several years hunting along the shores where the river of lava meets the sea and warms the waters. She made her home on a small rocky outcropping and an underwater cave, spending most of her days luring unsuspecting inhabitants of Ennui to their deaths. However, that all came to an end when she met Lussuria, on one such attempt.

The "young" devil had heard of the rogue siren, seemingly adrift along Ennui's shores. When people told of her, Lussuria recognized what he believed to be a kindred spirit - someone who desired for more than what life had originally given them. He ventured out to the beach and languished on the volcanic sand. Enevra, spotting what she believed to be her next meal, attempted to beguile him into the watery depths. She used her alluring voice (or what she thought she was doing) to bring Lussuria out to her lair, and Lussuria played his part. However, once inside, he made his true nature known and the two tricksters attempted to outsmart the other.

In the end, it was Lussuria who one, tempting Enevra into a deal of the ability to walk on land and have access to even more fruitful hunting grounds. He promised her the ability to transform into something more humanoid, with legs, and in return, he only asked for her soul when she died. Clever as she was, Enevra bargained, asking that not only her but her relations would also be given such a gift. Lussuria knew not of her royal blood and the effect he would have on her entire species. As soon as she agreed, Enevra's soul was whisked from her body into a green gem that Lussuria used to store his collections, and as her fin glowed, it split it two, showcasing the legs she would be able to walk on when she chose. 

When Lussuria learned what the deal had done, essentially changing the nature of all sirens and giving them the ability to hunt on land as well, he was furious at her own trickery. He used one of his champions to murder her, stealing her soul through foul means. He turned the green gem into a personal prison for Enevra's soul. However, it seemed that whatever dealhad been struck or tricks played, the Weave returned Enevra to Ennui as a corrupted siren, something more snakelike and still tied to Lussuria's bidding. Lussuria condemned her to one of his brothels where she worked for years as a companion. It was only once the Mundane opened and travel between the domains became even more common place, Lussuria opened up an inn in Edith and Enevra convinced him she was loyal - how could she not be when he had her soul?
