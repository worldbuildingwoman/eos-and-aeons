## Summary

Our party picked up on their way to The Blood Pits to watch the upcoming fight between "The Bastard" and reigning champion. As they made their way inside, a few in the party were awestruck while others were overcome with various emotions brought on by the smell of blood and the prospect of death. Wolf, in his excitement to participate in someway, sidled up to a nergalid to engage in some betting. After a little banter, the devil agrees to a bet but only on the second fight - between the Bastard and Obzarstwo, who he believes The Bastard will be beat, no questions asked. The battle begins and it quickly becomes apparent that The Bastard is not to be underestimated and Wolf's bet looks to be the better one. Rather than pay up, the Nergalid starts to crush Wolf's head and a fight ensues. Wolf, determined to do this himself, tries to take him one-on-one. The others hesitantly let it happen until Wolf's arm is nearly ripped off and the crowd around them starts to break out in their own fights. Alina and Morielle jump in with Phinneas and Wolf and manage to get his unconscious body away from the devil as he slips away. It's only when Alina nearly kills him on his escape that he pays up. Meanwhile, the baronness escapes to outside the area, finding a park bench to get some air at. It is here that she connects with Auden and Xixi who had just spent their hour at the Soul Gardens on business for Xixi. Auden learned that his mercnary friend has a debt she owes the madame there. He also met one of the workers, Melinoe, who makes conversation with him. Their conversation indicates she knows what he is and it's only when he goes to leave that he receives confirmation that she too is a nightmare. Once back with the Baroness, Auden makes the choice to open up and trust someone. It seems that the potion Marienne provided him has helped his demeanor and made him more amenable to company. As he opens up, the Baronness realizes she might not be as alone in her plight as she thought. The remaining four roll up, and the party prepares to head towards the Endless Wastes, in search of a Nothic named Lolligag.
