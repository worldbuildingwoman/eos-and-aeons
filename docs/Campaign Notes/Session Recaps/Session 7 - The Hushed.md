## Summary

Last session began with the group finding refuge in a delapitated homestead with a silent man who had found you in the woods. Through some questioning, you managed to learn his name was Rolf and that he was here after having lost his wife and son. After a little while, things seemed off and you all did a little bit of exploring which made you believe he wasn't telling the truth. Wolf did some sneaking around and found two graves outside but nothing to suggest kids had ever lived here. When asked why he doesn't speak, Rolf shows he cut out his tongue to avoid accidentally making any noise. Meanwhile, the ravens kept watch outside, keenly interested in the goings on inside the house. When the group is finally convinced something is off, a tussle occurs with Rolf casting Darkness. Carmilla, thinking to put Rolf off-balance even more, let the ravens inside. The party prevailed and as Rolf died, he burst into flames, leaving only his armor behind. The ravens, meanwhile, were swarming the water barrel which led Wolf to the trap door beneath it. Descending down into the well-lit cellar, the group found a warded sarcophagus, an ominous statue, and a ritual altar of some kind. It isn't long before another creature makes himself known, scolding them for disrupting his duty in protecting the endless that is inside. The boggle, who isn't supremely intelligent easily gave up some information and managed to keep some a secret. The party learned that Dream was who is being kept in the sarcophagus and the ravens kept attcaking it. It's only while the party tries to question Boggy further that the ravens manage to break the magical seals and the lid moves a fraction of an inch. We ended with the party making a wisdom saving throw as whatever was being kept here is now set free.
