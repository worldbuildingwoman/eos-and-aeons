The group heads along to Alina's but run into a boar attack on the road. They meet a man name Asher who warns them about an evil spirit abducting travelers who stray too far from the road. This leads them to an encounter where they witness a new figure harvesting a fallen soul. The group interrupts her work but they're all quickly descended upon by detached shadows. They defend themselves against the attackers and the Baronness uses this to her advantage to harvest the soul. Once the shadows are defeated the group spends some time arguing over who and what she is before agreeing to bring her back to Alina's with them where they are greeted by Alina's parents and Laila, their friend. We ended the session with the group splitting up to have various discussions and hopefully find some answers.
