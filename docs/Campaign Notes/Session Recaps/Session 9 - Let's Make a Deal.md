**Date:** 4/6/23
**Primary location:** [[The Wilds]], Masmirred's Cave

## Summary

Our heroes picked up in the depths of the Wilds, being led by their new friend, Boggy, towards the woman he referred to as the Lady of the Locke. The party spends the few hours walking with banter and some attempted flirting. As dusk decends, Boggy stands proudly in front of the maw of a great cave with the snowy peaks of the Trozian mountains in the distance. Phinneas and Morielle remember a rumor they heard in a tavern long ago about a genie in a similar cave that grants wishes. Carmilla is immediately off put by the idea and warns them all, but before anyone can catch him, Boggy runs inside to the Lady of the Locke and is only recalled after Wolf and Alina tell him there will be no more candy apples unless he behaves. However, the way is set and Masmirred the Mysterious makes herself known as the group arrives in the main chamber of the cave, filled with gold and treasure and also a pool of lava. Though it's a mixed reaction to her presence, it's only when Masmirred starts insinuating she knows things about them and proves her ability to intrude on their thoughts that the deals begin. Wolf immediately makes his deal, followed by Alina. Carmilla risks it without a deal, following the two into the lava. Phinneas flat out refuses and is left waiting for Morielle to have his conversation. Finally, he gives in, making his deal and ushering Phinneas across and into the pool with a drop of blood. Once on the other side, and the party sitting in Ennui, tensions continue to rise. Morielle's especially as whatever was blocking his memories begins to unwind and his temper snaps, revealing his true nature: a devil of Ennui. With this revelation, the party decides they have no choice but to try and get Wolf's information on his father and then get out of this plane as quickly as possible, so they set off for the Necropolis, looking for a creature Masmirred called "Lolligag".
