*(Based on the Tabaxi 5e race.)*

In the [[Domain - Fortuna]], not all beings are bringers of good luck. As with all things, there is a balance. Enter the black cats of the realm. Beings who stroll through life knowing that they bring misfortune to others. Some aim to use this to their advantage, while others see it as a curse upon themselves. Whatever their view, it is their gift from Fortune to bring to the beings of Eos. 

### History

Some say the originals of the black cats were a game of chance between [[Dream]] and [[Fortune]]. Others believe it was between Dream and [[Despair]], with Fortune as the judge. Whatever the true origins, black cats have lived their life as neutral bringers of ill fortune amongst the domains. Because of their penchant for bad luck, they have found favor with Despair but even there, few beings would be eager to cross paths with one of them. Their purpose in life is their own, with their Aeon, Fortune, believing as much in serendipity as balance. Black cats can be found working or adventuring, sometimes alone or sometimes with a party that has taken to them. Some would argue it’s better to have a black cat on your side than as your enemy. 

### Lofty and Detached

As is their nature, black cats are often creatures of chaotic or neutral alignment. They thrive in the unpredictability of everyday life and will sometimes seek to impose their advantage on others on mere whims. When with their own kind, they prefer to live in elevated places – tree canopies, caves, or mountains. Often extremely reclusive, they can be viewed as haughty or condescending to those they interact with. 

### In the Mundane

When in the Mundane, black cats can take either the form of a domestic black house cat or a human, and may transform between the two once per long rest. While in this cat form they can understand and read common but cannot speak. Their purpose while in the Mundane is to spread bad luck, as a reminder that life is random and not everyone is entitled to good fortune.
