The Aeon Time resides over order in the Eos multiverse. They interpret the Weave and how it relates to life and death and other natural cycles. They are the keepers of histories and guardians over them as well. Rarely does Time see fit to intervene in the petty differences of their siblings but when they do, it is at dramatic costs. In the Dread Wars, Time sent their reapers and phoenix into battle and turned things into a bloody battle, resulting in the reincarnation of many souls. Since the Divergence, Time seems content in Oraculum. They oversee their realm with a firm but fair hand. Oraculum emulates this as a land of unbiased, black and white.
