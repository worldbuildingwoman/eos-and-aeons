**Date:** 11/8/22
**Primary Location:** [[City - Pencaster]], The Pencasher Theatre

Last session, you were introduced to the city of Pencaster, a bustling place in Landrus. A place that, unknown to you, sits within the Mundane. First, we met our friend Aline. A curious girl who had traveled into town with a caravan and her new friend Ursula. She found herself at the Pencaster theatre, in the Westway, were she was convinced to watch the show. The Shadow over Wresk Garden, put on by the great Alexander Maximoff. The two head inside to find their seats, which is where they learn they're seated next to a quiet, seemingly withdrawn boy and the two adults that accompany him. On the other side of the theater, a group of children are being chaperoned by a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties. Morielle attempted to coax the kids into sharing when he was joined by another. Phinneas, a man dressed in religious garb. The show begins and it isn't long for things to take an odd turn. The audience is entertained by the miraculous appearance of flying multicolored sheep as they bounded around the room, and then, within the show, a curious acrobatic jester-like figure appeared. They seem to be part of the show but after a few more minutes, chaos ensues. An invisible foe appears in front of Morielle and Phinneas which they eventually see to be this horrid monster with spider-like legs and a pustulous face. For the most part, the audience and party attempt to flee, save for the girl who accompanied Alina inside. She runs right for the chaos and between her and the jester-like actor, Morph, the monster is turned into a bat as the theater empties. The party, curious about what it is exactly they saw, follow Morph backstage in various levels of accompaniment and stealth. Wolf, the most straight forward of them all, attempts to ask Morph directly what happened, with the bat to which Morph bites its head off and lets the rest of it turn to dust. Avoiding the questions, they laugh quietly to themselves and express things would be so much easier if you just went to sleep, and all of the party is thrown back in time to their beds that morning, seemingly awakening from a bad dream. Except for Alina, who knows that that was not a dream at all.Â
