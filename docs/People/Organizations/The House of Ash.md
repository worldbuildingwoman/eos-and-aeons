*The house stands tall, its stone facade weathered by centuries of existence. Its Gothic architecture boasts intricate carvings of intertwining vines, gargoyles perched upon its corners, and stained glass windows depicting scenes of darkness and immortality. The grand entrance, flanked by towering marble columns, is a heavy wooden door, closed with a lit torch on either side.*

*The entry opens into a dimly lit hall. As you step inside, you find yourself in a cavernous chamber that serves as the central gathering place for the coven. The space is adorned with sumptuous furnishings, crafted from rich, dark woods and velvety fabrics in hues of deep crimson and midnight black. Ornate candelabras cast flickering shadows across the room, illuminating portraits of long-forgotten ancestors who stare down with timeless, piercing gazes. The air within the house is cool and still, carrying with it the faint aroma of aged books. Enormous bookshelves line the walls, housing volumes of forbidden knowledge, arcane tomes, and accounts. A grand staircase ascends towards the upper levels, where you assume private chambers and resting places for the vampires can be found. The bedrooms are adorned with lush, velvet draperies that block out what little sunlight might shine here, while luxurious coffins of ebony and mahogany serve as resting places for the coven members during their slumberous repose. Paintings depicting moonlit landscapes and shadowy figures adorn the walls, whispering tales of forgotten bloodlines and eternal desires.*

*Deep within the heart of the mausoleum house, a hidden chamber serves as the coven's sanctuary. Bathed in soft candlelight, this sacred space is decorated with symbols of vampiric power and ancient rituals. An intricately designed altar takes center stage, adorned with black roses and silver candelabras. Here, the coven gathers to conduct secretive rites, drawing upon the dark forces that grant them their immortality.*

*Surrounding the Eternal Sanctuary is a meticulously maintained garden, a sanctuary of tranquility and deathly beauty. Moonflowers bloom beneath the pale moonlight, their ethereal petals shimmering like alabaster. Ancient statues, partially veiled in tendrils of ivy, evoke a sense of timelessness, while a small, still pond mirrors the starry sky above, casting an eerie, otherworldly reflection.*
