The Aeon Destiny is, at best, a myth these days. The eldest elves would know of her existance, as do her siblings, but for the most part, nobody has heard from her since the [[Divergence]] and thus a few believe her to have parished with the event that split [[The Multiverse - Eos|Eos]] into a multiverse.
