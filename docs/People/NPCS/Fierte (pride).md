**Pronouns:** He/Him
**Job:** Lord Justice on the Necropolis

Fierte, the devil ruling over the city of the dead, embodies the sin of pride in every aspect of his being. He is a towering figure, standing at least eight feet tall, with broad shoulders and a muscular physique. His skin is a deep crimson, with a lustrous shine that reflects the flickering flames of the surrounding torches. Fierte's eyes are a piercing yellow, with vertical pupils that seem to glow with an inner fire.

He is adorned with a resplendent suit of armor, made of the finest materials and adorned with precious gems and metals. Fierte carries himself with an air of arrogance and superiority, as if he is always looking down upon those around him. He is quick to anger and even quicker to lash out at anyone who dares to challenge his authority.

As the ruler of the city of the dead, Fierte takes great pride in his dominion. He sees the souls of the departed as mere playthings, to be manipulated and controlled for his own amusement. He revels in the suffering of those who are trapped within his domain, delighting in their despair and hopelessness.

Fierte is known for his cruelty and his insatiable thirst for power. He is not one to be crossed, and those who do so often suffer the most terrible fates imaginable. Despite his many flaws, however, there is a certain magnetism about Fierte that draws people in. His charisma and charm can be irresistible, even to those who know better than to trust him.
