## Summary

We picked up with the party heading out into the woods, the Baronness trailing behind. As she's dealing with the conflicting feelings about the new group, she's overcome with the shift of magic as she feels a death from the party is in her future and she'll be the one to escort their soul back. Using this as her guide, she returned to the group as they return to the glade where Eleanor was killed and try to pick up a trail from there. After some investing, the group found what appears to be a deer trail or something heading West, but the further along they go the more autumnal and decaying the foliage around them seems to become. While walking, Wolf shows Carmilla his book and she admits to being able to read it and help him translate it. Eventually, they're standing in an area of the woods that seems to be in the height of Autumn although it is the middle of Summer. They end up disturbing a patch of shrieker mushrooms that wailing mercilessly and end up serving as an alarm system for something much worse. As the party tries to cut down the shriekers, two corpse-like creatures with black eye sockets and flailing tentacles emerge. They manage to fight the creatures off, nearly losing Alina, but pull her back as a mysterious figure appears at the far end of the trail, gesturing for them to stay silent and follow. As they do, he leads them to a homestead in the woods with a tall wall adorned in trinkets and baubles. You headed inside and it is there we'll pick up.
