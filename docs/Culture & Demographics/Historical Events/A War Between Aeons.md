### The Beginning of the End

 In what started out as an olive branch and collaboration, the creation of the [[Elves]] quickly turned into a contest of egos. As each Aeon contributed a little more, [[The Weave]] that was creating one being started to sunder. With every squabble and rewrite, the Weave twisted until it was not one braid but four separate threads. This led to the creation of the four elven lineages but it also was further reminder of the strife between the Aeons. With the new race able to blend in more easily amongst the others, the Aeons began using the elves as spies against one another. Specifically Dream and Despair, as one sought to tease and the other to spite. With each passing prank, the brothers grew more and more intent on surpassing the other. 

### An Endless Sleep

 It was Dream who eventually took things too far. By suggestion of one of his most fearsome [[Nightmares]], Dream captured Despair in an endless sleep, tormenting his twin through his dreams. This imprisonment lasted for 100 years before Time, Fortune, and [[Destiny]] finally saw fit to intervene. When Despair woke, he was so furious at Dream, and at his siblings for not stepping in sooner, that he promised war on them all. All four aeons retreated back to their respective keeps in the unified [[The Multiverse - Eos]], believing Despair's threat to be an empty one. It wasn't until the first horde of [[Devils]] attacked a caravan of [[Leprechauns]] in search of Fortune's wealth-spring that he was taken more seriously. 

### The Dread Wars

 With that first attack, Despair pulled Fortune into the war almost immediately. Dream, eager to counter their twin's angst, dove in head first with their nightmares and [[Sirens (wip)]]. It was during the [[Dread Wars (wip)]] that Despair sought to undermine Dream's influence over his creations and took away their need to sleep. This was the point at which Time stepped in, claiming that Despair was overstepping in his influence on the natural cycle of things. Time's involvement in the Dread Wars turned it from a show of strength to a blood bath. With their creations. Being that they were the interpreters of the Weave's decisions on life and death, Time used their [[Reapers]] and [[Phoenix]] to collect more souls and turn the tides against Despair. The reapers cut beings down mercilessly while the phoenixes became kamikaze-style combatants on the battlefield. 

### Disappointing Fate

Disgusted in her siblings outburst and vulgur display of hubris, Destiny let the disagreements rip apart Eos in the way it had torn apart the elves, creating four new domains and leaving behind a gray swath of land that would become know as [[Domain - Mundane]]. This event, which caused the creation of the Multiverse of Eos and when Destiny disappeared, became known as the [[Divergence (wip)]].
