## Summary

The Necropolis is a desolate and eerie ghost town, with crumbling buildings and streets littered with bones and decaying debris. The once proud and opulent architecture is now in a state of decay, with rooftops caving in and walls collapsing in on themselves. The air is heavy with the musty smell of rotting wood and the faint scent of decaying flesh.

The town is home to an array of undead residents, each with their own tragic story of how they met their untimely end. Ghostly apparitions of these unfortunate souls can often be seen wandering the streets, lost and aimless in their unending existence.

Despite the desolation and decay, the town seems to have a strange kind of melancholic beauty. The moonlight casts an ethereal glow on the crumbling buildings, and the silence is only occasionally interrupted by the mournful howls of the restless spirits.

However, for the living, the Necropolis is a place of great danger. The undead that reside here are not always friendly, and travelers who venture too close to the town's borders may find themselves quickly overrun by hordes of ravenous ghouls and skeletons. It is a place best avoided by those who value their lives.

### Individual location of note 

**The Final Meal** - *The local Tavern run by [[Mordecai]].*
Stepping into the Final Meal, you're immediately greeted by the sight of a tavern that might have been something in its hayday. To your left, there's a crumbling fireplace with two seats before it despite the fact that it isn't lit. Around you, tables and chairs in mostly states of disrepair to downright disuse line the hall. However, they're not entirely abandoned. At some of them sit figures, most of them turning to glance at you as you walk in, their expressions unreadable. However, the most noteworthy thingi n the room is the large bar at the far end, behind which is a large stone carving. The entire wall is taken up by the top half of a skull. You can see in the empty eye sockets that some musty wood has been slotted in for shelves, and a few dusty bottles sit on them, right next to an actual skull. 

**Sanctum of the Wailing** - *Temple to Despair located in center of the city, run by [[Olanna]]*
Looking at the Sanctum, you can see the walls seem to be made entirely of black stone, with tall, narrow spires reaching skyward into the mist. You can barely make out the appearence of stone gargoyles atop them. At least, you think they're stone, until one takes flight at your approach and soars off with a scream. You hear another screech and the sound of ripping as they seem to fight in the mist overhead. It sends a shudder down your spine as you look back to the temple. The entrance is a set of massive black doors with silver handles that resemble bony fingers. On either side, there are intricate carvings depicting scenes of death, the afterlife, and suffering, including skeletal figures and winged beings. 

**Bastion of Grief** - *The castle at the back of the city, where [[Fierte (pride)]] rules while [[Despair]] is indisposed*
It's impossible to miss the bastion, even in the deense fog. The moonlight seems to cascade from behind its towers, casting a long shadow that looms over the city. In fact, it almost feels like that shadow is what gives everyone the sense of dread. The castle itself is a massive structure of dark stone and thick walls that seem to be more fortified than the rest of the city. The gates are made of iron and are guarded day and night by devils.

**Moonshade Elixir's aka Bloody Mary's** - *Apothecary run by [[Marianne]]*
As you move to the shop, you notice it's one of the smaller buildings in this area and seems to be the only one with windows that have been cleaned at all. The closer you get, you suspect it's because of the various plants you see perched in the window sill. The shop itself is made of dark grey stone with a weathered wooden sign above the door that reads Moonshade Elixirs in elegant script. As you enter the shop, you finally get the first smell of something that isn't dying. However, there's still a tinge of something burnt and vinegary on the air. The shelves lining the walls hold an array of jars and bottles, each labeled with delicate calligraphy denoting their contents.

**Blood & Ink** - Bookstore owned by [[Mr. Graves]]
The bookstore is  located in a small, dimly lit alley that's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. The entrance is marked by an old wooden sign with the store's name etched in faded gold letters. Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a musty smell, and the shelves are lined with books of all sizes and colors, ranging from old tomes to well-oiled leather covers. The shelves are packed with books on dark magic and necromancy, but there are also sections dedicated to history and the domains.

**The Blood Pits** - *the fighting pits where the original 7 often come to watch their kin face off*
The pit itself is a circular arena, surrounded by towering walls of stone and iron, with the ground made of packed dirt, stained with blood and littered with broken weapons and bones. The air is thick with the smell of sweat, blood, and burning sulfur. In the stands above, the crowd roars with bloodlust, cheering on their favorite combatants and jeering at those who falter. The gladiator pit is a place of violence, desperation, and savagery, where only the strongest and most cunning survive.

**Xixy's House** - *the house of the local mercenary, [[Xixy]]*
You pass by the small and unassuming cottage on the outskirts of town. It's easy to look over in the Shadowlands when things are painted black. However, if you look at the door, you'll see three horseshoes turned upward, nailed above the door. In the window, there's an attempt to grow something. Over each window is the symbol of an open eye, painted in a peeling paint and staring forward.
