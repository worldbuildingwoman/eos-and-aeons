## Summary

The party found themselves ambushed in an alleyway, a group of nilbogs and quicklings eager to alleviate the Baroness or the others of their belongings. The commotion that ensued quickly attracted the attention of some gremishkas that attacks, and the party began to learn how volatile creatures of Fortune could be. However, the party managed to batter them all, save for one nilbog, but he was quickly descended upon by a preying gargoyle and the party let the stone watcher leave with his prize. After a quick scour of the alley way, they collected their own spoils, and Carmilla used her magical awareness to confirm there was nothing else they had missed. This clued her into the new magical book in Wolf's possession although she did not mention anything in the moment. Eventually, they collected themselves and headed to the Charmed Embrace, where they found themselves in a decent space to rest and relax. Alina and Phinneas headed to their suite, and took a moment to talk about their motivations and the reason Alina was still with them. Carmilla, Wolf, and Morielle opted for some fun in the main areas, gambling and enjoying themselves. Wolf, having lost a few gold, headed back to the suite as well, and left Morielle and Carmilla to their devices. Morielle eventually bet that if he won, Carmilla would have dinner with him, and he managed to succeed. After that, Carmilla headed to bed as well, opting for her own room where she was quickly drawn a bath and a full body massage. Left on his own, Morielle sought out the most envious person in the room and landed on Enevra, the madame. They spoke and Morielle offered her freedom if she allied with him over his brother. Enevra, amused but not disinterested explained her soul belongs to his brother, Lussuria, and that he keeps all of his souls that he has not yet turned into Despair, around his neck. She explained her alliance can only be gained if and when her soul no longer sits around his neck. With that, Morielle headed back to the suite as well.
