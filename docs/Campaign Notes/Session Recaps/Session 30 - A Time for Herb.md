## Summary

After an eventful tumble through the Hall of Numbers and into a liminal space within the Labryinth, the party headed into the Study of Spokes to try and begin their journey through Oraculum. First, they had to pass through the gate where their names were recorded by one of the automatons. Some of the party decided to falsify their names in an effort to keep a low profile, which seemed successful. As they pass by the front desk, Morielle is struck with the idea to try and view Greed's book but it met with resistance and the explanation that any of the books belonging to individuals of that status (meaning of the Seven and similar) were part of their restricted section and were not viewable at the moment. As Morielle tried to push the issue, a security automaton was summoned and the party quickly decided to pull their friend from the library before anything more happened. Once out in the city, Niamh explained she had one errand to run, as did Carmilla, and deposited the other three at a bakery to wait for her. It's here that the party has an unlikely run in with Laila and the gentleman she was dining with, Horatius Chirat. She explained that she was here debriefing him on what she'd seen in the Mundane and was incredibly concerned as Alina explained everything the party had been through so far. As they all put together that perhaps their individual missions were related, Laila gave Alina a sending stone to stay in touch and agreed to do the same. She also gave Morielle some "fennelbria" (aka fantasy adderall) which worked to focus his chaotic energies when consumed. Niamh eventually returns and after saying their goodbyes to Laila, the group headed out on the first leg of their journey toward the Boundless Shade. After a day's journey, they attempted to rest in some abandoned ruins Niamh believed to be safe. However, it wasn't long before they were bothered by some dust mephits that attracted the attention of something larger. Combat ensued but the party managed to evade, distract, and separate the giants before calling it a night and bedding down again.
