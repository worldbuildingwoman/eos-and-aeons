A place that, unknown to you, sits within the Mundane. First, we met our friend Aline. A curious girl who had traveled into town with a caravan and her new friend Ursula. She found herself at the Pencaster theatre, in the Westway, were she was convinced to watch the show. The Shadow over Wresk Garden, put on by the great Alexander Maximoff. The two head inside to find their seats, which is where they learn they're seated next to a quiet, seemingly withdrawl boy and the two adults that accompany him. On the other side of the theater, a group of children are being chaperoned by a man who appears to be in his late twenties or early thirties. Morielle attempted to coax the kids into sharing when he was joined by another. Phinneas, a man dressed in religious garb. The show begins and it isn't long for things to take an odd turn. The audience is entertained by the miracluous appearence of flying multicolored sheep as they bounded around the room, and then, within the show, a curious acrobatic jester-like figure appeared. They seem to be part of the show but after a few more minutes, chaos ensues. An invisible foe appears in front of Morielle and Phinneas which they eventually see to be this horrid monster with spider-like legs and a pustulous face. For the most part, the audience and party attempt to flee, save for the girl who accompanied Alina inside. She runs right for the chaos and between her and the jester-like actor, Morph, the monster is turned into a bat as the theater empties. The party, curious about what it is exactly they saw, follow Morph backstage in various levels of accompanyment and stealth. Wolf, the most straight forward of them all, attempts to ask Morph directly what happened, with the bat to which Morph bites its head off and lets the rest of it turn to dust. Avoiding the questions, they laugh quietly to themselves and express things would be so much easier if you just went to sleep, and all of the party is thrown back in time to their beds that morning, seemingly awakening from a bad dream. Except for Alina, who knows that that was not a dream at all.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%200%20-%20The%20Beginning/#recap","title":"Recap:","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%200%20-%20The%20Beginning/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":"<p>The party levels up to Level 2</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%200%20-%20The%20Beginning/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Character(s) interacted with","text":"<p>Morph, Ursula</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%201%20-%20The%20Dream/","title":"Session 1   The Dream","text":"<p>Date: 12/1/22 Primary location: City - Pencaster, the Pencaster Theatre</p> <p>We started the morning off in the Wild of Landrus, where Alina woke up in her family's settlements. Sensing the dream was not so much a dream, she went about her day with a little more eagerness and perhaps some anxiety than before. After speaking with her parents, she set out on the road to Pencaster, coming across Ursula and her family a bit earlier in the day than she previously had. She helped them ford the river and then together, they headed for town. Meanwhile, Phinneas wakes up in his ramshackle apartment in Fog Harbor, having been recently displaced after part of the Clockwork Temple was destroyed. He goes about his morning prayers, and then heads into the city to tend to those in need until the time when he's supposed to meet up with Morielle. Morielle, who woke up in the Crystal Chalice with a start, found himself caught in a near panic attack with fear. He tried to explain a little to Ivy, the innkeeper, but didn't get far before going about his day. With Greyson, he headed over to the orphanage to check in on the kids, where he found Case by himself working on his vocabulary homework. A single word written in repetition on the page - Dream. After giving some sound advice to the boy, Mori headed out to the blacksmith for his day's work. Wolf woke up in his childhood home, in the bedroom still befitting a four year old and promptly began to hack off the head of his rocking horse to leave on his mother's bed. After an arguement had through the door and hearing his father trudge home, Wolf begrdugingly headed downstairs to join his mother on her errands. While in town, the strangers begin to run into one another again. Alina recognizes Wolf and his mother and attempts to interact, surprising Wolf. Then, Alina sees Morielle at the blacksmith's and engages in the same way. After a few hours, the group finds themselves individually back at the theater where, once again, the terrifying play-turned-nightmare is getting underway. Alina and Wolf manage to talk a little beforehand and even seek out Morielle and Phinneas, as everyone begins to recognize one another. Taking their seats, a little more distant from where the night terror landed before, they start to watch in horror as the previously night's encounter unfolds for them. However, this time, they use their dream to their advantage and manage to trap the night terror before Morph eventually turns it into a bat again and they kill it. Having caught Morph in their ruse and Ursula in her lies, the group attempts to question them both as they all head back stage for a little privacy.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%201%20-%20The%20Dream/#recap","title":"Recap","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%201%20-%20The%20Dream/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Character(s) interacted with","text":"<p>Morph, Ursula, Xalvador, Peyton, Bala, Ivy, Greyson, Erica, Case + the kids</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2010%20-%20The%20Final%20Straw%20in%20the%20Final%20Meal/","title":"Session 10   The Final Straw in the Final Meal","text":"<p>Date: 4/13/2023 Primary location: Ennui, Necropolis, The Final Meal</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2010%20-%20The%20Final%20Straw%20in%20the%20Final%20Meal/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Arriving in Ennui, the party headed into the Necropolis. A stark and dreary place, as the name might suggest, they were at a loss of where to go first until the sign for a tavern, The Final Meal, came into view. Morielle immediately headed inside, followed by Phinneas, while Alina and Wolf had a moment together, expressing their concern over what has happened, who the people they're traveling with are and everything that may be in store for them. Carmilla hung back but eventually composed herself and headed inside as well. The party - specifically Morielle - was immediately greeted by the bartender, Mordecai, who seems to know the devil and addresses him by the name Lord Invidious. Morielle, trying to play it cool, does not let on that he doesn't know anything that Mordecai is talking about. Tensions were still high and a little inner-party animosity got the better of him, leaving Morielle no choice but to storm out or risk making a scene with Wolf. While Phinneas headed outside to try and calm his friend, the rest of the party tried to get some more information out of Mordecai about who Invidious is. Meanwhile, Boggy is called over to a pair near the fire, men who he addresses as Master. Alina, noticing Boggy's absence, follows him over and saves the boggle from potential torture and death by standing up for him to Garen, a pale man who looked like the man they killed in the cabin, and a vampire that Mordecai would later identify as a Master of the House of Ash. Further conversation about needing to get to the Endless Wastes leads the party to be directed to Xixy, the Black Cat in the corner, who is already deep in conversation with another figure, Auden. Finding that their destinations are similar, Xixy says she'll make the trip with both parties, so long as they keep their heads down and their wits about them. The Waste, it would seem, is not for the faint of heart. With an hour to kill, Auden headed off to the apothecary, while the rest of the party rode their inner-party tension a little longer and rested in Morielle and Wolf getting physical until Phinneas, Carmilla, and Alina manage to break them up. We ended with the group leaving the tavern, trying to find some way to kill an hour so they don't end up killing on another.</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2010%20-%20The%20Final%20Straw%20in%20the%20Final%20Meal/#recap","title":"Recap","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2010%20-%20The%20Final%20Straw%20in%20the%20Final%20Meal/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":"<p>Morielle's real name: Invidious</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2010%20-%20The%20Final%20Straw%20in%20the%20Final%20Meal/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Characters Interacted With","text":"<p>Mordecai, Boggy, Garen (darkling), unknown vampire, Xixi, and Auden</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2011%20-%20Of%20Friends%20and%20Enemies/","title":"Session 11   Of Friends and Enemies","text":"<p>Date: 4/25/23 Primary location: Ennui</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2011%20-%20Of%20Friends%20and%20Enemies/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Picking up outside of The Final Meal, Carmilla heads to the apothecary with Phinneas and Morielle following, while Alina trails Wolf as he storms off into the city. In his hightened-tempered state, Morielle tries to recall some more memories with no luck. Auden is actually the first to get to the apothecary, where he tries to hurry Marienne along in the potion she's making for him, however she assures him that it won't help to be rushed and asks him to give her a little more time. In that window, the others arrive and Carmilla asks the others to wait outside. Auden wants Phinneas nowhere near his person though and tries to push the man inside. Unfortunately, Phinneas bests him and so Auden just puts more space between himself and the others. Once inside, Carmilla has her conversation with Marienne and receives something of her own. Meanwhile, outside, Morielle tries to sneak a peek through the window to see what Carmilla might be up to. Unfortunately, the Baronness spies him and he has to quickly duck away. Auden, growing impatient, draws the attention of Morielle and Phinneas who consider the stranger's state. Morielle heads inside to join Carmilla, where Marienne points him towards the temple - the Sanctum of the Wailing - and to his brother at the Bastion, as well as a wanted poster with Invidious's face on it. The poster read \"The devil Invidious, dead or alive, 5000 for his head or 10000 if alive and brought in. To the Fate Dealers at the Prosperity Casino.\" He learns that in Ennui, he has a little bit of protection. Being one of The Seven buys him some influence, although suggests his siblings might turn him in. Regardless, Marienne suggests that Morielle start there to better uncover his memories. Outside, Phinneas tries to connect with Auden, only to be pushed away and threatened. Morielle and Phinneas head off and Morielle loses his temper, exasperatedly expressing that he wants to know he mattered to someone. When Phinneas expresses that he matters to him, Morielle says that's not enough. Phinneas chooses to walk away to blow off his own steam. Morielle heads to the temple but doesn't make it inside. Instead, he overhears some other pedestrians talking about the Blood Pits and someone named The Bastard. When he asks, they suggest that the bastard is Invidious's boy, leaving Morielle perplexed but he manages to get some memories this time. A memory of a little boy in the Mundane, running back inside to his mother. With this in mind, he has a new destination of the Blood Pits. While all of this is happening, Wolf is jumping across rooftops. Alina, following from the ground, with Boggie does eventually lose him, but sends Boggie after him and decides to go to the bookshop to wait for him. In Blood and Ink, Alina finds the shop apparently empty but as she ventures in further a voice sounds from behind her and introduces himself as Mr. Graves. Alina recognizes him as similar to to the Lord Ash, meaning a vampire. They spend some time asking him questions and he directs them to a book about the Dread Wars and a book of fairytales called The Grimm. He gives them a little more information on the Dread Wars and the Order of the Grim. On their way out, they run into Phinneas, finding the cleric upset. They commiserate a little bit about Morielle's attitude before heading back to the tavern. Eventually, Morielle makes it back and apologizes to Phinneas, dragging the cleric back into his issues and they return to the group as Xixi and Auden join them as well. Morielle, wanting to check in on the Pits, convinces the party to go there before leaving town, as Xixi and Auden promise to meet them outside.</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2011%20-%20Of%20Friends%20and%20Enemies/#recap","title":"Recap","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2011%20-%20Of%20Friends%20and%20Enemies/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2011%20-%20Of%20Friends%20and%20Enemies/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Characters Interacted With","text":"<p>[[Marianne]], [[Mr. Graves]]</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2012%20-%20A%20Variety%20of%20Hedonism/","title":"Session 12   A Variety of Hedonism","text":"<p>Date: May 11, 2023 Primary location: Ennui - The Blood Pits and the Soul Gardens</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2012%20-%20A%20Variety%20of%20Hedonism/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>Our party picked up on their way to The Blood Pits to watch the upcoming fight between \"The Bastard\" and reigning champion. As they made their way inside, a few in the party were awestruck while others were overcome with various emotions brought on by the smell of blood and the prospect of death. Wolf, in his excitement to participate in someway, sidled up to a nergalid to engage in some betting. After a little banter, the devil agrees to a bet but only on the second fight - between the Bastard and Obzarstwo, who he believes The Bastard will be beat, no questions asked. The battle begins and it quickly becomes apparent that The Bastard is not to be underestimated and Wolf's bet looks to be the better one. Rather than pay up, the Nergalid starts to crush Wolf's head and a fight ensues. Wolf, determined to do this himself, tries to take him one-on-one. The others hesitantly let it happen until Wolf's arm is nearly ripped off and the crowd around them starts to break out in their own fights. Alina and Morielle jump in with Phinneas and Wolf and manage to get his unconscious body away from the devil as he slips away. It's only when Alina nearly kills him on his escape that he pays up. Meanwhile, the baronness escapes to outside the area, finding a park bench to get some air at. It is here that she connects with Auden and Xixi who had just spent their hour at the Soul Gardens on business for Xixi. Auden learned that his mercnary friend has a debt she owes the madame there. He also met one of the workers, Melinoe, who makes conversation with him. Their conversation indicates she knows what he is and it's only when he goes to leave that he receives confirmation that she too is a nightmare. Once back with the Baroness, Auden makes the choice to open up and trust someone. It seems that the potion Marienne provided him has helped his demeanor and made him more amenable to company.

Unfortunately, as the night progressed, the clanging drew in visitors. A fight ensued in which the party was attacked by several shadows, scarecrows, and will-o-wisps. Auden and Carmilla both went down but the party was able to bring them back up. However, in the midst of battle, in an arguement over Boggy's role during the fight, the boggle attacked Morielle and was then cast down by the rogue as he deemed the creature a threat to the party. After the creatures were defeated, a heated debate broke out in which everyone in the party was upset with Morielle, and even went so far as to attack him for what he'd done.

Upon approaching the sweltering hot red desert, Xixy reminded everyone to stay quiet, to which Auden attempted to aid them all by casting silence on an item he was carrying and moving it with the party. This worked for the most part, but as they began to move through the canyon, the sound of roars and lightning cracks -- which turned out to actually be some sort of gun shot-- caught their attention as they were dragged into battle with an aberrant giant and two new NPCs. While the party did their best to defeat the giant, the noise of this encounter alerted the real threat - a huge purple worm that could borrow its way through the canyon walls, and packing one hell of a razor-sharp bite. While Morielle tried to draw it away, the war-forged fighter would not let him go alone and when he was swallowed, it drew his companion and then the rest of the party back, going against Morielle's commands. The party did eventually bring the beast down but not before both the warforged and Phinneas were eaten. During all of this, Carmilla remained out of the fight and instead focused on the other beast that was watching them all, the nothic, Lolligag, who gave the Baroness a riddle but remained unaggressive.

Ahead of the party joining, Auden asked a few questions of the nothic including where he might find Destiny and the Order of the Grim. Neither answer was very helpful, but the group did at least get a semi-rough location for the Order of the Grim - which was repeated to Wolf later, when the monk asked the Nothic about it as well. For the rest, Morielle was the other individual to receive a cryptic message, one that focused on his missing memories and a hint at something else he lost - Resentment and Bitter Pain. With nothing else to ask, the group let Lolligag go and had Yelle lead them to the cave where she claimed to have awoken the abberation giant with AuTee. Here, the players attempted to take their rest. Auden began ritually detecting magic in the hopes of finding some hint as to where the giant had come from, while Carmilla took her space, Phinneas napped. Yelle, Morielle, and AuTee took first watch during which it was a painful first hour of the group having to listen to their flirting but before the watch could close, Yelle attempted to cast Command on him and it was only when it failed that the group was alerted to the fact that she wasn't who she claimed. AuTee and Yelle immediately went on the offensive, attempting to capture Morielle, while Xixy warned Auden not to interfere. As the fight broke out, they nearly made it away, with Auden's quick thinking against Yelle's celestial heritage but an unfortunate misunderstanding from Phinneas as he was waking up broke the effect, allowing Yelle to grab Morielle and AuTee and planeshift. Wolf was the only one near enough to grab onto Morielle as he too was pulled away in the blink of an eye.

Heated in her temper, Carmilla approaches Alina and suggests making some kind of loud noise outside, to draw attention to Xixy, as a form of payback. Alina is less eager to give into her rage but is equally as distraught. Phinneas, seemingly in a state of disassociation, stares stoically at the wall of the cave while Auden exits to find Xixy. It doesn't take much, as the mercenary is just outside the cave entrance, cooling off. There are some tense but honest words exchanged where Xixy acknowledges she can hear the others but won't apologize for doing what she thought was right. Together, they head back inside to try to at least offer up an olive branch in the form of directions on how to find Wolf and Morielle. Carmilla remains livid, saying she can't possibly be trusted, but Auden casts Zone of Truth on her and Xixy expresses that she's being honest - she'll help them find the others, as her purpose to free herself of debt and Auden of his bounty are done. There's no winning Carmilla over but Xixy does offer up a nugget of information that seems to silence the Baroness for now. Alina, unable to rest, heads out on a walk, trying anything to make sense of what happened. She attempts to use Locate Object to find the necklace Yelle spoke of, but instead comes to the realization that it was a lie, meant to cover up the real prize: Invidious. She heads back but not without some company as a group of large locust and praying mantis like creatures watch her from afar. Meanwhile, in the city of Edith, in the domain of Fortuna, Morielle and Wolf are being escorted through the streets. After an unsuccessful attempt by Morielle to distract and escape, it is Wolf's turn. It nearly succeeds until AuTee seems to anticipate Morielle's escape and holds him tighten. Yelle also drags Wolf back with her whip, to explain that he's free to go, if he'd like, or he can come along and see how things unfold. However, Morielle tells Wolf to go have some fun and promises that he'll be alright and before the mercenaries can get him to where they're going, Morielle manages to escape with the help of his echo and flees into the city. It's only by happenstance that he hides in the same venue that Wolf got distracted in - The Charmed Embrace, a pleasure and gambling den that is owned by no other than Morielle's brother, Lussuria. After some more shenanigans and fortunes read, the two hatch a plan to disguise themselves and steal Yelle's necklace before escaping again and finding their way back to their friends. They go through a whole montage of getting pampered and dressed in drag before heading out and momentarily getting sidetracked by some ultra successful pick-pocketing that left them feeling the blessing of good fortune. With that in mind, they set off to find Yelle and AuTee. Back in Ennui, the rest of the party sets out for the Necropolis again but not before some grief-filled and angry words between Phinneas and the Baroness. They're uneasy about trusting Xixy but also express a distrust for Auden and the tricks he has up his sleeves. Auden overhears this but waits to address it until they're back in The Final Meal, where he explains he's done nothing but try to help them since they've set out on this journey together, giving them every reason to believe he's trustworthy. The pair claims it still isn't enough to have earned their trust, and the group is left in an highly tense state of who is ever who they say they are.

However, things did not go quite as Morielle had hoped and as he reached for the necklace, found it no longer around Yelle's neck as the pair rounded on him, closing in and seeing through his disguise. A fight ensued, where Morielle and Wolf attempted to focus their hits on Yelle, doing a decent enough amount of damage before she and AuTee knocked them both out and took them to the Prosperity Casino, to turn them in. Here the pair sat unconscious for a day and a half before awakening in the lush office of the leprechaun casino boss who enlightened Morielle to the debt that put the bounty on his head. A whopping 100,000 gold - or a little less after he confiscated the money they'd pick-pocketed on the streets. Here, Morielle tried to persuade him to make a bet - double or nothing - as well as offering empty threats as to the state of his capture but the boss - or Ed as he said Invidious usually called him - seemed unphased. Even going so far as to let the devil know that his siblings barely blinked at the idea of a bounty on his head, making it clear that nobody would be getting retribution for Yelle's treatment of him. Instead, Ed offered Morielle a deal - find an artifact called the keycoin and his debt would be wiped clean. The only lead - it seemed Invidious was the prime suspect in its disappearance a year ago when Invidious was winning at a game and suddenly p and disappeared. Before the pair is set free, Ed put a tracking necklace around Morielle's neck and promised that if he did not return in a month, the chain would short to the point of decapitation and any additional attempts to tamper with it could result in the same. After this, the pair headed back to the Charmed Embrace where Enevra sent them back to Ennui, to the Soul Gardens, through Lussuria's private teleportation circle. It's here that Morielle meets his brothers for the first time and quickly realizes how much he still doesn't know - including the existence of a mortal woman and child whom he loved - and how shitty his family actually is. He leaves in a huff, angry and raging with Envy as the devil in him starts to come out. Meanwhile, on Team Emotions, Phinneas gets the best night of sleep in his life thanks to a familiar Dream elf who creates a peaceful escape from his usual nightmares. Bala and Phinneas have a discussion where she offers him some sage advice and gratitude for the party returning Dream to Reverie. She gifts him a flower that should help him find his way back here if he ever needs it, and the offer to just sit and be with him should he ever want company in his dreams. Alina woke up and waited for the group in the Final Meal, Carmilla headed out early to try and meet up with Marianne but found her shop closed and dark. A ghostly figure walked past, explaining \"Isn't it sad. She hasn't been back in days...\" before continuing on with his walk. She then headed to Blood and Ink to converse with Mr. Graves there who gives her a some details about the House of Ash but not much before she spots the family portrait and recognizes the dark features of Isabella - the vampire Xixy warned her about. Auden also tried to make a stop to the apothecarist and finds it closed, receiving the same ghostly message but additionally that Marianne left on her own. Returning to Xixy's, Auden talks about the need to get to the Crypt of Contrition, while also offering his own words of wisdom to the Black Cat who seems to have a very cynical outlook on life. They agree to check in with the rest of the party first and it is then that things start to come back together. Alina, Phinneas, Auden, and Xixy are contemplating their next steps when Wolf barges in with a wild story about their return. They start to head to the Soul Gardens where they find Carmilla on her way back and then eventually Morielle, who is acting not quite himself and rages with envy at the party before Phinneas is able to calm him down somewhat.

Being led by Xixy, they reached the outskirts of a large cemetery that spanned as far as the eye could see. The group picked through a few graves, reading names and epitaphs. It's Morielle who finds something of interest when he notices a stone with the Baroness' name on it. \"Carmilla Zarkova: In life, there is no neutral. You either live or you die.\" Intrigued, he starts digging it up to see what he can find and ends up meeting two kobold grave robbers who are looking for bones as well. He borrows their shovel in exchange for the promise of a few bones. However, after a while, it become clear, there's nothing buried here. Meanwhile, Wolf and Alina look for an unmarked grave where Wolf's father might be. While they don't see anything, they do see a symbol within a mausoleum that matches the moon shapes throughout Wolf's book. Auden casts Detect Magic to get a better idea of what he might be looking for, but the only thing that lights up besides his companions magical items, is the mausoleum itself. Carmilla has kept her distance for a bit but eventually wanders over and sees a tombstone with Seraphina Duskwood's name on it - Lord Ash's wife. It seems enchanted to remain pristine, and earns the comment of another passing figure who pauses to chat with Carmilla for a minute. She learns a little bit more about the House of Ash and also that Isabella has been through here recently, as the wereraven points off in the direction of the frantically digging Morielle. The group arrives at Carmilla's grave in time for Morielle to see there's nothing in there. Enraged at his desecration, Carmilla throws him back only to be pointed to the stone and see her own name. Controlled but still boiling, she kicks the gravemarker in half and encourages the party onward, to find Wolf's father. Inside the mausoleum, the group finds six plain sarcophagi and a riddle - paint their blood on the skeletal door to find the key. Xixy and Boggy hang back to watch the entrance but each member of the party paints their hand and watches as the sarcophagi shift in appearence, each unique to them. It's only once they climb in and witness flashes backs from their past, memories they've forgotten or seen from a different perspective, that they open back up and the party is let out. Wolf saw for perhaps the first time how human his parents were and understood more about why his life was the way it was. Alina saw the trial where her parents were exiled for Pencaster as well as a shady figure who seems to have played a role in their guilt. Auden watched himself as a nightmare, feeding on the sleeping dreams of an orphaned child. Carmilla saw, for the first time, how she had been attacked while in Ennui to collect a soul and understood the game Isabella had made of it. Morielle saw the terror that his family has wrought on his personal life as he was encouraged to kill a mortal boy and woman - delivering a wound that he recognized as Bloody Mary's. (PHinneas' will be determined when Ryan is back!) Once out, Morielle falls into a mental breakdown and only barely manages to pull it together as the party is given two doors - through the skeletal one or through the endless stairs that appeared in Wolf's tomb. They opt for the stairs and end up stuck in the dark for hours, falling a few times before they realize the stairs are enchanted and they have to put out the lightsources and close their eyes in order to find the door. Once they do, they push inside to a wide antechamber that is lit by candles, smells of fragrant jasmine and lilies. They see several tapestries on the walls and then, in the distance, some monk acolytes pranking each other, only to be scolded by a presumed teacher who spies the party. Surprised but welcoming, it's Wolf who steps forward to show the man his book and it becomes clear to the monk who he is and what he's doing here. The party is invited further inward with the promise of food, rest, and answers.</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2018%20-%20Digging%20Up%20Past%20Lives/#recap","title":"Recap","text":"<p>Forgot to record! </p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2018%20-%20Digging%20Up%20Past%20Lives/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2018%20-%20Digging%20Up%20Past%20Lives/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Characters Interacted With","text":"<p>[[Xixy]], Boggy, [[Zephyr]], Tagi the wereraven, Gorn and Snepo the kobolds</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2019%20-%20Order%20and%20Chaos/","title":"Session 19   Order and Chaos","text":"<p>Date: August 3, 2023 Primary location: Ennui, Order of the Grim</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2019%20-%20Order%20and%20Chaos/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>We picked up the session with Phinneas's experience in the tomb. It wasn't pleasant but it wasn't anything more than what he's used to seeing in his nightmares. Fast forwarding back down into the Order's hideout, the group was escorted to the Mess Hall - which was really just a few tables - and brought out some tea and refreshments. The tea was made of a magic flower similar to the one Bala had given Phinneas, and Zephyr explained that when steeped in cold water and consumed, it will remove a certain amount of exhaustion. While in here, they see a few of the initiatives in the corner who seem very interested in the newcomers but doing their best not to intrude. Zephyr goes on to explain more about the Order's history including how they were formed after the Dread Wars by Saint Vespen, and how it resides in secret to offer balance to the domains where others would seek to conquer and spread - like the Seven. It was shared that Caspian Void was one of their most prominent fighters and eyes in the world, that he fought Despair's first creation, Void, thus earning his name. The book Wolf possesses is also Caspian's personal journal and a practice amongst the Order, but it would appear Wolf's is special, for Caspian found out how to preserve some of his own ki into it, granting Wolf the boost to his abilities as he's learned from it. Prior to his disappearance or murder, Caspian was looking into the missing of Dream, not believing it to be Despair. After some careful prying and flashbacks of Morielle's, the party learned that Caspian believe Fortune to be involved somehow and Invidious was one of his sources, as the pair had worked to infiltrate Fortuna before Invidious lost his memories. Carmilla shared that she has a brief memory of Caspian being attacked and that it supports his murder by the vampires, but Zephyr also seemed perplexed as to why the vampires would be intent on stopping Caspian's mission in Fortuna. With all of this new information, Wolf was eager to enroll and pledged himself to continuing Caspian's search with the party as well as finding out what really happened to his father. Leaving the dining area, the group was introduced to more Order members including Breana, a pink cupid-black cat that grew immediately flustered upon seeing Xixy. Auden was also approached by an initiate named Gloom who said she recognized him and had something for him from Destiny. The party ended in the initiation room, where Wolf had convinced Zephyr to let them watch Therion's last trial but as they entered and sensed the magic happening Invidious recognized the trial for what it was - a face off with Despair's original creation, the thing all creatures should fear, the Void.</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2019%20-%20Order%20and%20Chaos/#recap","title":"Recap","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2019%20-%20Order%20and%20Chaos/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":"<p>Level 5</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2019%20-%20Order%20and%20Chaos/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Characters Interacted With","text":"<p>Zephyr, Griff, Kaelin, Breana, Gloom</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%202%20-%20Behind%20the%20Curtain/","title":"Session 2   Behind the Curtain","text":"<p>Date: 12/8/22 Primary location: City - Pencaster, Crystal Chalice, the orphanage</p> <p>After another harrowing experience at the Pencaster theater, the group managed to convince Ursula and Morph to share more about what was going on.

The Masters have to call the rite, forcing the Void back into the rift end ending before Thalion's full initiation is complete. Zephyr joins the group to discuss what happened and expression confusion, however through all of this, Wolf seems proud to have been recognized. That pride continues into a fit of hysteria as the Void springs forth a rift of its own and joins the group with two other monster as well, forcing them into battle.

They made it out without incident this time, and took the skeletal door into the Crypt as opposed to the endless stairs to the Order.

The pair of bounty hunters move on just as Phinneas emerges from the tavern on a fiery brink, to which he and Alina quickly make their way down to the river and Phinneas tosses himself in. The water is enough to quench the flames for now and he reemerges looking pale and gaunt before he and Alina return to Carmilla on the bench. Wolf had joined her and the two unlikely Despair-touched individuals have a moment discussing their shared connection with the vampires of Ennui and what to do about it. Phinneas apologizes to Wolf, and then he and Carmilla also have a private moment, discussing Morielle and what happened in the tavern. At the end of this, the group realizes Morielle is no longer in the tavern and after asking the bartender if he had seen the man leave, begin to head in the direction of Lucky's Bazaar of Fate, the first of three locations Morielle wrote he might be. While all of this is happening, Morielle headed off in search of his contact, the Black Cat, Dortish, who he found skulking around Lucky's Bazaar, convinced that the fight in the tavern had been about him. Invidious asks if the cat has any idea about the keycoin or his disappearence but the cat only says that they haven't heard from him in months. He suggests checking with the valkyerie, Sevastyan, at the Pegasus' Roost, as the braggert has a mouth that just won't quit. Satisfied he's exhausted the informant, he decides to purchase a few things for his companions, as part of his apology and begins to head back towards the tavern. Eventually, the party finds Morielle and they all duck into an alleyway where in Morielle manages to goad Carmilla again, still on edge from their brawl in the Tarnished Coin, and convinces her to unleash some of the anger she's clearly holding for him. Accepting the beating this time, Morielle admits that they share a connection - more than the flirting he kept insisting on - but a love for the woman turned revenant and he begins sincere apologies to the group, and especially Phinneas, that ends in tears. It is only then, as the two men are hugging that Carmilla notices her cane, discarded in the fight with Morielle, is being stolen by some gremlins.</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2024%20-%20Honesty%20in%20Violence/#recap","title":"Recap","text":""},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2024%20-%20Honesty%20in%20Violence/#rewards-granted","title":"Rewards Granted","text":"<p>Morielle bought a Broom of Flying, a Scroll of Warding Bond and a scroll of Feather Fall</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2024%20-%20Honesty%20in%20Violence/#characters-interacted-with","title":"Characters Interacted With","text":"<p>Lucky, Dortish, </p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2025%20-%20Gremlins%20and%20Gambling/","title":"Session 25   Gremlins and Gambling","text":"<p>Date: 1/18/2024 Primary location: Fortuna</p>"},{"location":"Campaign%20Notes/Session%20Recaps/Session%2025%20-%20Gremlins%20and%20Gambling/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The party found themselves ambushed in an alleyway, a group of nilbogs and quicklings eager to alleviate the Baroness or the others of their belongings.

However, the party managed to batter them all, save for one nilbog, but he was quickly descended upon by a preying gargoyle and the party let the stone watcher leave with his prize. After a quick scour of the alley way, they collected their own spoils, and Carmilla used her magical awareness to confirm there was nothing else they had missed.

Wolf, having lost a few gold, headed back to the suite as well, and left Morielle and Carmilla to their devices. Morielle eventually bet that if he won, Carmilla would have dinner with him, and he managed to succeed. After that, Carmilla headed to bed as well, opting for her own room where she was quickly drawn a bath and a full body massage. Left on his own, Morielle sought out the most envious person in the room and landed on Enevra, the madame. They spoke and Morielle offered her freedom if she allied with him over his brother. Enevra, amused but not disinterested explained her soul belongs to his brother, Lussuria, and that he keeps all of his souls that he has not yet turned into Despair, around his neck.

Alina overhears that this is the first time in 100 years that Fortuna has attended one of these and they surmise that's too much of a coincidence.

After a long rest, the party awoke refreshed, with Alina gaining advantage on Athletics, Morielle on Religion, and Phinneas on Performance and Investigation. They ate a quick breakfast before Morielle headed off to pick up his new shortsword of venom and then to meet Niamh at the fountain outside the Jade Palace. After blending into the crowd at the Jade Palace, they witness Lady Fortune for the first time - wearing a different face than Morielle remembers and seemingly much beloved by her people. Many in the crowd had thrown trinkets in her path, in the hopes that they might turn to riches in her wake. The Assembly seems a chore to sit through until a little plasmoid - the one that had been previously seen being escorted out of Ed's office - made his case for a new alliance between the realms of Fortuna and Reverie in the form of a trade route on the rainbows, it's then that Fortune stood and gave an impressive speech about change and throwing away the threads of the past. This caused such a discourse that the party was able to use it as a distraction and snuck out, using their wiles to navigate their way through the palace and to the Hall of Numbers.

Some of the party decided to falsify their names in an effort to keep a low profile, which seemed successful. As they pass by the front desk, Morielle is struck with the idea to try and view Greed's book but it met with resistance and the explanation that any of the books belonging to individuals of that status (meaning of the Seven and similar) were part of their restricted section and were not viewable at the moment. As Morielle tried to push the issue, a security automaton was summoned and the party quickly decided to pull their friend from the library before anything more happened. Once out in the city, Niamh explained she had one errand to run, as did Carmilla, and deposited the other three at a bakery to wait for her. It's here that the party has an unlikely run in with Laila and the gentleman she was dining with, Horatius Chirat. She explained that she was here debriefing him on what she'd seen in the Mundane and was incredibly concerned as Alina explained everything the party had been through so far. As they all put together that perhaps their individual missions were related, Laila gave Alina a sending stone to stay in touch and agreed to do the same.

As Andrei helped his daughter, Alina, tend to her wound, she explained the extent of the day they had and how wild it was. Andrei doesn't recall Ursula's group passing through but he does seem to believe her and reminds her that he's never had a reason to doubt anything she says. Meanwhile, the Baronness and Phinneas see to the dead body of Eleanor with Laila, getting the first peek into the blonde woman's house but spending most of it preforming their own little resting ceremonies over the deceased. Laila recognizes Phinneas when he speaks Epoch as does the Baronness and there is a silent moment exchanged while Morielle watches from the doorway. As they leave to regroup, the Baronness spots a few ruins carved into the outside walls of the outpost, in seemingly random locations.\u00a0Morielle continues exploring and finds himself at Laila's cabin. Suspicious of what she might know, he finds a way inside and begins to scout a round, eventually finding a journal where she's kept a daily record of her life as well as strange symbols in the margins. They seem like drawings at first but Morielle makes a copy to show to Phinneas when they're alone.\u00a0Wolf wanders off a bit to do some exploring of his own and eventually Alina catches up to him. They share a comforting moment as Alina shares a bit about how her parents were exiled and what it was that brought them out to the Wilds to begin with. Wolf shares his book with Alina, in which she can pick up a bit about Ennui and see that some of it is written in another language. Eventually, she leaves him to rejoin the fire and Wolf spends a bit of time practicing before returning as well.\u00a0It's not until Alina's parents and Laila head to bed that the group begins to have a conversation with one another -- or rather, multiple, as Phinneas and Morielle communicate via Message. When the group does turn to a singular conversation, things get a little flirty between the Baronness and Morielle, while also growing uncomfortable for some of the others. They all eventually head to bed, but the Baronness holds back to do a little scouting of the runes.\u00a0Laila finds her and seems unsurprised she recognized them. The two share a brief exchange witnessed by the silent Morielle who gets the confirmation that Laila knows more than she's letting on. He cooks up a plan, pulling Phinneas into it, and attempts to threaten her into sharing what she knows. However, as he presses his knife into her throat, assuming she'll cave, he witnesses his first time elf magic as she takes them back by a few seconds and flips the script on him. She tells him she won't answer questions for him but will for Phinneas.\u00a0Phinneas shares that he is a phoenix, or believes he is. The Baronness joins them. Laila challenges what Phinneas believes about life and death and how Time handles them. Baronness asks if she's really going to tell them everything, but when Laila tells Phinneas to make fire, he does, much to his surprise. Laila can only acknowledge that it's strange that he doesn't know who he is but that she also hasn't met many to confirm. They all express concern over Wolf, but Laila's priority seems to be keeping Alina safe.\u00a0Laila offers to help with Phinneas' sleep, bringing out a sleep potion, and with that they head to bed, but not before she warns the Baronness about what Phinneas could be and what he's capable of.

During this, the grass entangles around her foot momentarily as if to acknowledge it before the pair set off back to the camp.\u00a0Morielle has risen fairly early, set upon working on his new armor. Phinneas finds him busy tanning the leather and cutting up the rough breastplate for rivets. His intention is to turn it into studded leather. Phinneas sits down to help by feeding the fire with his new found firebolt, and shares his dream from the night before. Morielle does his best to console his friend but can't help but feel a little frustrated by the man who has more knowledge, albeit confusing knowledge, than he himself has. Together, they throw back some booze before Laila shows up to fetch them for breakfast.\u00a0Intent upon getting answers, Morielle tries to bargain with her. He offers to try and find whatever is kidnapping and hurting travelers in exchange for answers.

As a young princess, she was clever but unsatisfied with the life of a singing seductress of Reverie. She followed the currents of Nostalgia into the land of Despair and it was here she found a feeding ground of plenty - and entire domain that desired nothing more than some sliver of happiness or to be put out of their misery for good. </p> <p>She spent several years hunting along the shores where the river of lava meets the sea and warms the waters. She made her home on a small rocky outcropping and an underwater cave, spending most of her days luring unsuspecting inhabitants of Ennui to their deaths. However, that all came to an end when she met Lussuria, on one such attempt.</p> <p>The \"young\" devil had heard of the rogue siren, seemingly adrift along Ennui's shores. When people told of her, Lussuria recognized what he believed to be a kindred spirit - someone who desired for more than what life had originally given them. He ventured out to the beach and languished on the volcanic sand. Enevra, spotting what she believed to be her next meal, attempted to beguile him into the watery depths. She used her alluring voice (or what she thought she was doing) to bring Lussuria out to her lair, and Lussuria played his part. However, once inside, he made his true nature known and the two tricksters attempted to outsmart the other.</p> <p>In the end, it was Lussuria who one, tempting Enevra into a deal of the ability to walk on land and have access to even more fruitful hunting grounds. He promised her the ability to transform into something more humanoid, with legs, and in return, he only asked for her soul when she died. Clever as she was, Enevra bargained, asking that not only her but her relations would also be given such a gift. Lussuria knew not of her royal blood and the effect he would have on her entire species. As soon as she agreed, Enevra's soul was whisked from her body into a green gem that Lussuria used to store his collections, and as her fin glowed, it split it two, showcasing the legs she would be able to walk on when she chose. </p> <p>When Lussuria learned what the deal had done, essentially changing the nature of all sirens and giving them the ability to hunt on land as well, he was furious at her own trickery. He used one of his champions to murder her, stealing her soul through foul means. He turned the green gem into a personal prison for Enevra's soul. However, it seemed that whatever dealhad been struck or tricks played, the Weave returned Enevra to Ennui as a corrupted siren, something more snakelike and still tied to Lussuria's bidding. Lussuria condemned her to one of his brothels where she worked for years as a companion. It was only once the Mundane opened and travel between the domains became even more common place, Lussuria opened up an inn in Edith and Enevra convinced him she was loyal - how could she not be when he had her soul?</p>"},{"location":"People/NPCS/Erica/","title":"Erica","text":"<p>Pronouns: She/her Job: Orphanage headmistress</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"People/NPCS/Fierte%20%28pride%29/","title":"Fierte (pride)","text":"<p>Pronouns: He/Him Job: Lord Justice on the Necropolis</p> <p>Fierte, the devil ruling over the city of the dead, embodies the sin of pride in every aspect of his being.

Stepping into the Final Meal, you're immediately greeted by the sight of a tavern that might have been something in its hayday. To your left, there's a crumbling fireplace with two seats before it despite the fact that it isn't lit. Around you, tables and chairs in mostly states of disrepair to downright disuse line the hall. However, they're not entirely abandoned. At some of them sit figures, most of them turning to glance at you as you walk in, their expressions unreadable. However, the most noteworthy thingi n the room is the large bar at the far end, behind which is a large stone carving. The entire wall is taken up by the top half of a skull. You can see in the empty eye sockets that some musty wood has been slotted in for shelves, and a few dusty bottles sit on them, right next to an actual skull. </p> <p>Sanctum of the Wailing - Temple to Despair located in center of the city, run by Olanna Looking at the Sanctum, you can see the walls seem to be made entirely of black stone, with tall, narrow spires reaching skyward into the mist. You can barely make out the appearence of stone gargoyles atop them. At least, you think they're stone, until one takes flight at your approach and soars off with a scream. You hear another screech and the sound of ripping as they seem to fight in the mist overhead. It sends a shudder down your spine as you look back to the temple. The entrance is a set of massive black doors with silver handles that resemble bony fingers. On either side, there are intricate carvings depicting scenes of death, the afterlife, and suffering, including skeletal figures and winged beings. </p> <p>Bastion of Grief - The castle at the back of the city, where Fierte (pride) rules while Despair is indisposed It's impossible to miss the bastion, even in the deense fog. The moonlight seems to cascade from behind its towers, casting a long shadow that looms over the city. In fact, it almost feels like that shadow is what gives everyone the sense of dread. The castle itself is a massive structure of dark stone and thick walls that seem to be more fortified than the rest of the city. The gates are made of iron and are guarded day and night by devils.</p> <p>Moonshade Elixir's aka Bloody Mary's - Apothecary run by [[Marianne]] As you move to the shop, you notice it's one of the smaller buildings in this area and seems to be the only one with windows that have been cleaned at all. The closer you get, you suspect it's because of the various plants you see perched in the window sill. The shop itself is made of dark grey stone with a weathered wooden sign above the door that reads Moonshade Elixirs in elegant script. As you enter the shop, you finally get the first smell of something that isn't dying. However, there's still a tinge of something burnt and vinegary on the air. The shelves lining the walls hold an array of jars and bottles, each labeled with delicate calligraphy denoting their contents.</p> <p>Blood &amp; Ink - Bookstore owned by [[Mr. Graves]] The bookstore is  located in a small, dimly lit alley that's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. The entrance is marked by an old wooden sign with the store's name etched in faded gold letters. Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a musty smell, and the shelves are lined with books of all sizes and colors, ranging from old tomes to well-oiled leather covers. The shelves are packed with books on dark magic and necromancy, but there are also sections dedicated to history and the domains.</p> <p>The Blood Pits - the fighting pits where the original 7 often come to watch their kin face off The pit itself is a circular arena, surrounded by towering walls of stone and iron, with the ground made of packed dirt, stained with blood and littered with broken weapons and bones. The air is thick with the smell of sweat, blood, and burning sulfur. In the stands above, the crowd roars with bloodlust, cheering on their favorite combatants and jeering at those who falter. The gladiator pit is a place of violence, desperation, and savagery, where only the strongest and most cunning survive.</p> <p>Xixy's House - the house of the local mercenary, [[Xixy]] You pass by the small and unassuming cottage on the outskirts of town. It's easy to look over in the Shadowlands when things are painted black. However, if you look at the door, you'll see three horseshoes turned upward, nailed above the door. In the window, there's an attempt to grow something. Over each window is the symbol of an open eye, painted in a peeling paint and staring forward.</p>"},{"location":"The%20Multiverse/Ennui/Necropolis/#geography","title":"Geography","text":""},{"location":"The%20Multiverse/Fortuna/Domain%20-%20Fortuna/","title":"Domain   Fortuna","text":"<p>Alternative Name(s):  The Realm of Fortune Type: Dimensional Plane Owner/Ruler: Fortune</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"The%20Multiverse/Fortuna/Domain%20-%20Fortuna/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>A realm of balance, Fortuna is governed by Fortune, the lady of luck.

The Sands of Time being a vast desert with dunes made of the sleeping sand. The sands eventually taper off into grasslands and eventual temperate forests that surround the elven city of Dreamspire. To the northwest is the Nosalgia Sea, home to the merfolk and the keepers of memories. Dreamspire is buttressed on the northeastern side by the jagged mountains and darkened brambles of the Terrors, for not all dreams are happy ones. Then, to the southwest lies the Cumulus Cliffs, overlooking the sea.

Their petty disputes, his and [Despair]'s in particular, was especially heavy on Dream's mind as he slumped down into the wet sand and let the seafoam lap at his feet. It was then that he felt the tug of the ocean waters. He rose slowly, wading out until he was up to his waist. Observing his reflection in the water, he watched as his passing thoughts and memories were mirrored back to him, filling him with regret and anger. Above, the sky began to reflect that energy and the ocean began to roil.\u00a0For five days, Dream stood in the water, mesmerized by his own regrets and memories. When his loyal commander,\u00a0Hulum Lunala, found him, pulling him from the waters, Dream was despondent with grief. However, the moment he was pulled from the ocean, the waves began to settle and the storm subsided.
