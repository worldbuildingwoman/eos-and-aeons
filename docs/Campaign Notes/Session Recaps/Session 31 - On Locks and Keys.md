## Summary

Heading into the Boundless Shade, the group eventually comes to a firenewt colony. Niamh gives you a few minor warnings - mostly directed at herself and Morielle - before you are granted passage inside to fill up on water. It's here that the group meetings Ignatius Cinderheart, who seems jovial enough with Niamh to help get you all a few giant striders to ride the rest of your journey. Equipped with these faster beasts, you continued on, eventually reach the gultch that you feather falled to the bottom of. At Nimah's direction, you manage to solve the fungus puzzle that is the key to opening Cera's hideout and are greeted by an impressive sanctum hidden inside the cliffside. Here, you met Danarune, the minotaur that seems to be Cera's protector, and Cera herself. A talented arcane phoenix who helped Morielle escape his collar. In order to prevent it alerting Ed, you all attempted to place the collar around the pommel of the giant's sword you carry, and it seemed to do the job. Afterward, you headed back inside to get some well-deserved rest, with the worst of your urgency behind you. Cera explained a little bit more about Phinneas' historyin the Mundane and Niamh's role in it all. She also informed the party that Phinneas has a wizard's tower himself somewhere, although she has no idea where he's hidden it. The only clue would be the Ryze's talon, a family heirloom that's likely to still be there, and the idea that its somewhere where there are pigeons, per Henrietta's disclosure. Morielle, freed at last, headed outside to get some air and walk off his frustrations, managing to have a kind conversation with Niamh who follows to keep an eye on him. Here, he sees the brand on her arm that seems to be activated, a summoning that she's trying hard to resist and is only surpressed in Cera's sanctum. After a while, you all regroup inside and settle in for the night, debating on your next steps - to figure out what the deal with Fortune is, to continue after the Keycoin and Greed, or to adjust your course now that the threat of a swift beheading isn't shadowing your way.
