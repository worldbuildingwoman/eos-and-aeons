## Summary

As the party started off their morning, they spent some time considering their options in bargaining with Masmirred. Morielle suggested that they steal souls from Lussuria. Others suggest stealing from Masmirred herself to play her. Others offered up the idea that perhaps they were just in need of a powerful enough spellcaster to break Morielle out of the necklace rather than follow through with getting Ed the keycoin. The party split, heading off into the city to see about other options. Phinneas and Alina headed to Prosperity Casino to talk with Ed. They convinced him to give them the gold they would need to bargain with Masmirred - 10k platinum in a bag of holding. While Morielle and Carmilla headed to the Pegasus' Roost, first stopping at The Iron Fang, a smithing shop where Morielle commissions a shortsword of venom in exchange for two vials of purple worm toxin. they continue on to the mercenary's guild and commit to a charade of a married couple whose son - Thadeus von Burencraft - had been kidnapped. They ask after Niamh who is a devil in the mercenary group and Morielle spies the brand of Wrath on her arm. The pair also spy a familiar valkerie and her automaton tracker in the other room. Niamh stepped away to get the pair a drink, leaving them to conspire and consider the potential consequences of their visit here.
