**Pronouns:** She/They
**Job:** Grave Cleric

In the dimly lit temple of the sanctum, a female attendant glides gracefully across the marble floors. She wears a long black robe that drapes down to her feet, adorned with intricate silver embroidery of skeletal figures and swirling patterns. Her hair is pulled back in a tight braid, exposing the sharp angles of her high cheekbones and the intensity of her dark, penetrating eyes.

Her movements are slow and deliberate, like a predator stalking its prey. She carries herself with an air of quiet confidence and a calmness that belies the macabre nature of her surroundings. Her duties involve tending to the rituals and ceremonies of the temple, performing purification rites, and assisting the priests in the preparation of offerings to the goddess.

Despite her formidable appearance, there is a certain serenity about her that draws people in. She speaks in a soft, melodic voice that carries an otherworldly quality. Her presence brings a sense of peace and comfort to those who seek solace in the temple.
