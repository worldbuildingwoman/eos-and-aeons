## Summary

The party took a moment to get their bearings before heading to a tavern known to Morielle, the Tarnished Coin, to rest and begin to make their plans. They found the tavern as a hub of interesting individuals, and attempted to spend some time scoping out the patrons and their conversations. Auden, immediately hid to avoid being seen by some of the Dream elves in the establishment. Alina and Wolf made conversation with some of the patrons, learning primarily of a pair of Oraculum Elves who were looking to pay handsomely to anyone who could get them back to Oraculum. Phineas kept to himself while trying to keep an eye on Morielle, while Carmilla waited at the bar. However, as she was sitting there, Morielle attempted to flirt but ended up crossing a line when he jokingly referred to Mary with "Remember when I killed your friend?" before sauntering off to find his contact in the bar. Carmilla attempted to control her rage toward the comment. He didn't get far before Wolf alerted him to the twins large reward and as they started to hatch a plan to "lighten their pockets", Carmilla attacked Morielle and a brawl between the two ensued. Phinneas did what he could to try and subdue Carmilla but also made it clear he just didn't want Morielle dead - she could hurt him without issue. The rest of the party watched, unsure of whether or not to intervene and some believing he needed the beat down. After a few rounds of trying to get her to come out of her rage, Morielle slipped away using his echo and hid until she was calm enough to walk away. During the fight, Wolf seized the opportunity as a distraction and tricked the elven siblings into giving him all of their belongings. As the group separated to cool their heads, Wolf spotted a Dream elf and a plasmoid (another creature of Reverie) eyeing Auden, and sought to get the information they had by pretending he was hunting Auden as well. Wolf learned Auden has a 10,000 gold bounty on his head if he's returned to Reverie, and they intend to be the ones to do it. Letting them pass, Wolf moved to buy drinks for his friends in an effort to bring them together, and as he went to pay realized his new loot had twice as much gold as they promised and something even more interesting - the book of Invidious.
