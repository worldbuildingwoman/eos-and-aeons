The master of Ennui and twin to the Aeon, [[Dream]]. Despair's history is frought with conflict and negativity. He's often seen by his siblings to be the most emotional and reactive of all the aeons. It was his initial attack on Fortune's beings that started the [[Dread Wars (wip)]] and consequently led to the [[Divergence (wip)]]. In the years after the Divergence, Despair has sunken even more into himself. He's rarely seen outside of his own realm and many think he's plotting his revenge for "losing" against the others.
