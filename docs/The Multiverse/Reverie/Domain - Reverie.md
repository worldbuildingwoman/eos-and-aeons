## Summary

Ruled over by the weaver of dreams themself, Reverie is a beautiful and chaotic realm. It thrives on desire and creativity, nurturing the innate chaos of the universe into creation. The saying goes that anything is possible in Reverie. Like the other Aeons, [[Dream]] interacts frequently with the [[Domain - Mundane]] , helping to give their lives excitement and vision during their short lifespan. They are perhaps the most fascinated by what the Mundane  world is capable of and are enthralled by their potential for greatness. Although it is often thought to be the most fantastical of all the realms, Reverie is not without its depth. For while some dream of light, others dream of darkness.

### Nostalgia Sea

An endless span of water made of pure starlight and memory, home to the [[Sirens (wip)]] and a treacherous place to those who are not at peace with their own past.

### Dreamspire

The castle keep where the Aeon Dream rules from and in the surrounding city where most of the Dream [[Elves]] call home. 

### Sleeping Sands

The desert-like home of the sands used to perpetuate dreams. It eventually flows into the Sands of Time. 

### The Terrors

A swath of darkness in Reverie that houses many of its darkest creatures and [[Nightmares]]. It is the quickest way to [[Domain - Ennui]]. 

### Cumulus Cliffs

The airy stratosphere region of Reverie that houses the [[Cupids]] and other aerial dream creatures, and has a connection to the cloud region of [[Domain - Fortuna]].

### Geography

Like of the domains, the realm of Reverie mimics the Mundane in many of its geological features. The mountains to the north, the coast lines, etc. However, because Reverie is home to Dream and his beings of chaos and creativity, the land is ever changing and constantly contradicting itself. To the south lies the warmer climates. The Sands of Time being a vast desert with dunes made of the sleeping sand. The sands eventually taper off into grasslands and eventual temperate forests that surround the elven city of Dreamspire. To the northwest is the Nosalgia Sea, home to the merfolk and the keepers of memories. Dreamspire is buttressed on the northeastern side by the jagged mountains and darkened brambles of the Terrors, for not all dreams are happy ones. Then, to the southwest lies the Cumulus Cliffs, overlooking the sea. Pink and blue cotten candy clouds float around here and are home to the Cupids and other winged creatures of the realms.

### Ecosystem

Considering that Reverie is an everchanging place, twisted by Dream's chaos magic and its inhabitants, the realm and other creatures are incredibly adaptable. They learn to lean into change and go with it, knowing that it's madness to fight something that was never meant to remain stagnant. However, there are pretty solid deliniations between the various regions of the realms, considering the more whimsical and seredipitous of the dreamers do not like engaging with the darker beings that go bump in the night.

### Localized Phenomena

The skies of Reverie are unlike any of the other domains. Where most stick to the white and gray clouds of the Mundane, Reverie's skies are often dotted with the colors of a rising or setting sun, regardless of the time of day. The air hangs heavy with smells of nostalgia, and scents that cling easily to the memories that fuel the mental dreamscapes of sleeping individuals.

### Climate

Reverie's climate varies depending on the region. The south and western areas remaining warmer and more temperate, where the north and eastern regions grow colder and downright dreary for most of the time.

### Fauna & Flora

As if diverse regional biomes weren't enough, Reverie's chaos magic has led to a plethora of unique flora and fauna through all of the realm. Wild in color and silhouette, each stems from a dream wisp that either Dream himself or one of his creature thought up. The most common are the sentient beings that inhabit the realm: the elves, the cupids, the mermaids, and the nightmares. However, Reverie has grown and there are plenty of creatures made of joy and fright to be found in the area.

### Natural Resources

Reverie's most prominent resource is the Sands of Time. At first, Dream thought it was just part of the chaotic implosion caused by Destiny that gave him such an inifinite resource to be used, but he eventually learned it was to be the thread of his connection with his brother. While most of the sands sit in Reverie, a brave soul can attempt to find their way through the sands and perhaps end up in Oraculum. The sands themselves are most potent sedatives and can be used to put individuals to sleep in small amounts. Large amounts however can be detrimental to an individuals mental health, and those not familiar with magic have ended up in comas due to accidental exposure or overexposure to them.

### History

In the aftermath of the Divergence, as Destiny shattered Eos and the other Aeons were sent tumbling into their new worlds, Dream was the first to land in what would eventually become Reverie. Tossed into the desert dunes of the Sands of Time, Dream rose to find himself surrounded by the hot and shiny particles. The very subtance that he used to lull individuals to sleep; the very thing that his sibling, Time, used to keep track of the passing minutes and hours. Irate at his loss and disgruntled with Destiny, he began to trudge through the sands until he found the first of his elves who had been cast out as well. Helping them to their feet, and gathering the others as they came upon them, Dream began to realize the potential of his new domain. The Divergence had not only shattered Eos as they knew it but the magic that had once been intertwined throughout their single universe was flickering around all of them. With each step, Dream could feel the potency of the sands around him, and so could the elves. Immediately, Dream began to use their abilities to spin dreams into reality, thoughts into material, and Reverie was born.
