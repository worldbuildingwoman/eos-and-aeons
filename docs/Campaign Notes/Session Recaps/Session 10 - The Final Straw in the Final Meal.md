## Summary

Arriving in Ennui, the party headed into the Necropolis. A stark and dreary place, as the name might suggest, they were at a loss of where to go first until the sign for a tavern, The Final Meal, came into view. Morielle immediately headed inside, followed by Phinneas, while Alina and Wolf had a moment together, expressing their concern over what has happened, who the people they're traveling with are and everything that may be in store for them. Carmilla hung back but eventually composed herself and headed inside as well. The party - specifically Morielle - was immediately greeted by the bartender, Mordecai, who seems to know the devil and addresses him by the name Lord Invidious. Morielle, trying to play it cool, does not let on that he doesn't know anything that Mordecai is talking about. Tensions were still high and a little inner-party animosity got the better of him, leaving Morielle no choice but to storm out or risk making a scene with Wolf. While Phinneas headed outside to try and calm his friend, the rest of the party tried to get some more information out of Mordecai about who Invidious is. Meanwhile, Boggy is called over to a pair near the fire, men who he addresses as Master. Alina, noticing Boggy's absence, follows him over and saves the boggle from potential torture and death by standing up for him to Garen, a pale man who looked like the man they killed in the cabin, and a vampire that Mordecai would later identify as a Master of the House of Ash. Further conversation about needing to get to the Endless Wastes leads the party to be directed to Xixy, the Black Cat in the corner, who is already deep in conversation with another figure, Auden. Finding that their destinations are similar, Xixy says she'll make the trip with both parties, so long as they keep their heads down and their wits about them. The Waste, it would seem, is not for the faint of heart. With an hour to kill, Auden headed off to the apothecary, while the rest of the party rode their inner-party tension a little longer and rested in Morielle and Wolf getting physical until Phinneas, Carmilla, and Alina manage to break them up. We ended with the group leaving the tavern, trying to find some way to kill an hour so they don't end up killing on another.
