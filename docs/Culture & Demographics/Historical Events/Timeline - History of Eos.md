+ The Beginning
+ 3000 B.D.
+ In the Beginning there existed one universe within [[The Multiverse - Eos|Eos]]. A place where all of the Aeons - Destiny, Time, Fortune, Dream, and Despair - lived and created together. They made this word as they saw fit, occasionally collaborating but usually in their own ego.

+ Creation of the Elves
+ 1000 B.D.
+ After years of watching her siblings squabble and harass one another with their own creations, Destiny imposed a challenge: to create a mortal lineage together. Thus the elven race was created. However, it didn't go quite according to plan...

+ The Dread Wars
+ 10 B.D.
+ After the creation of the elves and the disagreements between the Aeons that arose from it, the Dread Wars began. Squabbles turned into fights and eventually war. The Dread Wars lasted for ten years before Destiny intervened and caused the Divergence.

+ The Divergence
+ 0 B.D.
+ To end the Dread Wars, Destiny split Eos into multiple domains, giving each of her siblings their own residence, creating a magic-less world in the Mundane, and then disappeared.

+ The Mundane is Discovered
+ 700 A.D.
+ The Reverie Elves are the first to learn they can use the dreamscape to travel to the Mundane, where humans have begun evolving. After this discovery, the rest of the elven races began finding ways to get into the Mundane to appease their curiosity and that of their Aeon.

+ Current Day
+ 1885 A.D.
+ Current day, where our campaign begins.
