**Languages:** You can speak Common and any one language of your choice

**Divining Sight:** You learn Guidance and one 1st-level spell from the School of Divination. You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Your spellcasting ability for this abilities spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. For every 2 character levels you gain, you choose another spell of the next casting level from the School of Divination and may cast that spell without a spell slot, and may cast those further spells using any spell slots you have. (For example, at 3rd level you gain a 2nd level Divination spell, and at 5th level a 3rd level divination spell.) 

**Power of the Mind:** A master of psychic abilities, you have heightened mental barriers that only you control and thus resistance to psychic damage. 

**Empathic Attunement:** You can see another's aura, giving you advantage to insight checks as you read and understand another's emotions. The target must make a Wisdom save to keep their emotions from you. Empathy is a wide range ability, with a passive range of 30 ft., however you have disadvantage when surrounded by a group of 5 people or more. Tread carefully as another's strong emotions can easily overwhelm yours. It is useless against constructs and undead and takes up an action to use in combat.
