*(Based on the Fairy 5e race.)*

Who doesn’t love love, right? That was the thought Dream had behind the cupids of Eos. Beings meant to spread love through the realms with a shot of an arrow. In hindsight, Dream can see how chaotic such a being is but what’s done is done and cupids roam Eos like the rest of Dream’s creatures. Much to the dislike of Time who sees them as manipulating their domain and encroaching on that of Destiny.

### History

Short of the Nightmares, Cupids are one of [[Dream]]’s most chaotic creations. They move through the realms, doing as they see fit and with whatever motive they hold in their hearts. They are mischievous creatures who live primarily in the Cumulus Cliffs, under the rule of the [[Queen of Hearts (wip)]], but will also move about [[Domain - Reverie]] and the other reams as they see fit. Under the rule of the Queen of Hearts, they have spread love and infatuation throughout many of the realms but have also sown a great deal of strife because of it. Amongst their own kind, they are prone to jealousy and bickering over the potency or legitimacy of their marks. Highly competitive, cupids will find themselves hardly cheribic when in their court. Dream lets them do as they please for the most part, however, and only intervenes when it threatens the other areas of his realm. 

### Feisty and Fleet-footed

Cupids are fickle creatures, prone to mood swings and fleeting interest. They can be quick to incite or easy to bore. Paired with their wings, this makes them hard to keep around unless they want to be. That being said, when a cupid’s interest is captivated, one may find it hard to shake.

### In the Mundane

While in the Mundane, a cupid’s wings are incapable of holding flight and are invisible to the naked eye. It is only within the magic of the weave that they can move about the air as they please. Their purpose is to spread love throughout the Mundane, under Dream’s command, and are thus common antagonists with demons.
 
**Creature Type:** Humanoid 
**Size:** Small 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed when your wings are visible. 
**Ability Score Increase:** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Suggestions would be Dexterity, Charisma, or Wisdom. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20. 
**Languages:** You know Common and one other language of your choice. 

**Spot Your Mark:** A cupid’s weapon of choice is generally ranged, and thus they have proficiency in ranged weapons. 

**Charm the Charmer:** Incredibly charming by nature, this gives cupid’s the upper hand against similar wiles and they are immune to being charmed. 

**Cupid Magic:** You know the friends cantrip. Starting at 3rd level you can cast Charm Person with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast Suggestion with this trait. Once you cast either, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell splots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

**Geographic Distribution:** [[Domain - Reverie]]
