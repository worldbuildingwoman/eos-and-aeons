**Date:** 3/23/23
**Primary Location:** [[The Wilds]], cabin in the woods

## Summary

In the cellar of the cabin, the party all feel a rush of air leaving the room, almost as if creating a vacuum. For what feels like an eternity but is only a few moments, they are trapped in visions of their own nightmares. Completely isolated in darkness, it is only Alina who can see through it to the being who emerges from the sarcophagus, surrounded by ravens. The being is obsurced save for their eyes, which are deep galactic pools as they stare at Alina and say in her head "Sleep to forget, but dreams remember" and then vanished with the ravens and leaving behind only a pile of iridescent sand. As the party recovers, they investigate the sand. Wolf watches as it turns to smoke. Choosing to bring the book along with them, the party heads back upstairs to get a long rest and try to make sense of their findings. Morielle decides to invite Boggy along with them, making him his own personal sticky fingers, while Alina goes out of her way to get him a scarf and a candy apple. Eventually, the party leaves, heading North at Boggy's direction towards what he refers to as "the Lady in the lock". However, on the way, it leads them through a spider-infested part of the forest and the party has to fight off a few ettercaps and a giant wolf spider before they can continue forward. In rough shape, the party opts for a short rest, before letting Boggy lead them into who knows what else.
