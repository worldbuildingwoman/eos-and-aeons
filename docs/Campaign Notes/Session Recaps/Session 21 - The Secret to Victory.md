## Summary

The session began in the depths of the Whispering Wood. The group tried to get their bearings again and ended up hearing a strange melancholy song being played in the woods. As they debated where to go next, they decided their best course of action was to avoid the Grim Piper that was playing and instead skirted around him back towards the Crypt of Contrition, where they entered into their crypts for the second time. This go around, each individual saw new visions, tied to their backgrounds or looming questions on their mind. They made it out without incident this time, and took the skeletal door into the Crypt as opposed to the endless stairs to the Order. The Crypt of Contrition's interior chamber was adorned with a number of statues in varying degrees of disrepair, that depicted the Saints of the Grave, individuals who have played an important role in Ennui's history. Across the chamber, praying in front of one, is Marianne. Carmilla immediately goes over to her but the moment the woman is pulled from her prayers and recognizes Invidious' presence, she goes into a rage and attacks the devil. Combat ensues, drawing the attention of some not so fun catacomb haunts but the party prevailed, with the exception of Phinneas who is exhausted and in anguish trying to stifle his abilities. Marianne flees, leaving the party to talk things through. While Invidious is explaining the reason she attacked, Auden is deep in investigating what appears to be a sarcophagus for Destiny - elegantly and beautiful crafted. On it was a specific engraving - "In death's embrace, a truth unveiled, that life's fleeting but love prevailed. Despair, contrition, and death entwine, a cycle of existence, divine design." Towards the end of Invidious' explanation, and unveiling the truth that he has spent a lifetime looking for a phoenix soul to best his siblings, Phinneas openly and freely offers his. He insists Invidious take it and when no one intervenes, the devil is left to give into his nature, and seizes the offer, leaving the party unsure of the consequences and what happens next.
