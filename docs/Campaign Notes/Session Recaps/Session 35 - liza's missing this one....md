**Date:** 6/20/24
**Primary location:** Phinneas's Tower, Tempor, Oraculum

## Summary

After clearing the rest of the way through the brewery, the party arrived at a hall filled with seven mirrors. A puzzle, devised by some version of Phinneas, centered around The Seven. They cleared the puzzle, revealing the hidden entrance to Phinneas's wizard tower and begin their ascent. Upon reaching it, they were greeted by the disembodied voice of S.A.M. With a clever persuasion check, they managed to confirm Phinneas was who he said he was and the automaton let them inside. The tower's interior was an arrangement of rooms all dedicated to Phinneas's research goals of finding a way to stop his cycle of regeneration. They explored a bit, finding a previous Phinneas's journal and learning that perhaps his research had been dangerous and led to the death of a mortal research assistant. Thus S.A.M. had come into play, but within his wizard to guide him, the automaton was left to his own devices, interpreting his orders as he needed to. He displayed a few instances of minor magic to the party before they found him in the highest turret, surrounded by a few suits of animated armor as a defense. Having answered all of his questions along the way, S.A.M held a positive view of the party and believes Phinneas is indeed his master returned. The party exited the tower, retrieving Ryze's Talon (Phinneas' family heirloom) with him releasing the magic that held the brewery in stasis and headed to the Sleeping Sword Inn for a much deserved night's rest. The intent to go to the Crossed Arsenal to meet Aran in the morning, who had helped past Phinneas build S.A.M. and might have some idea where it had all gone awry.
