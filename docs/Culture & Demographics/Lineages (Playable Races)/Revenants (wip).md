(Based on Reborn 5e.) 

**Creature:** Undead 
**Size:** Medium 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength increases by 2, and your Constitution increases by 1. 
**Languages:** You speak Common and one other language you knew when you were alive. 

**Deathless Nature:** You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:
-   You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
-   You have advantage on death saving throws.
-   You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

  
**Unholy:** Unlike other undead, you can be restored through healing magic, but it has a significantly dampened effect on you. When you regain hit points from a source that specifies it does not function on undead, you only receive half as many hit points as the source would normally provide, rounded down. 

**Darkvision:** Through the necromantic energy animating you, you are able to perceive with greater clarity that which lurks in the darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Eternal Vengeance:** You know at all times the general direction of and relative distance to a specific intelligent creature of the DM’s choosing against whom you seek revenge for your death, even if the creature and you are on different planes of existence. Should this creature die by your hand or that of another, you instantly know, and your DM chooses another creature also responsible for your death for this feature to apply to, should such a creature exist. 

**Unnatural Vitality:** When you drop to 0 hit points, you can choose to stay conscious instead of falling unconscious. If you do, you gain temporary hit points equal to your total character level + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), which last for up to one minute. In this state, you can take an action or bonus action on your turn, but not both, and can move only half of your movement speed. You remain in this state until you regain hit points, or until you no longer have temporary hit points. If you lose all temporary hit points in this state while you are still at 0 hit points, you fall unconscious and begin making death saving throws as normal. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
