## Summary

The final and perhaps most misunderstood Aeon is Despair. Underappreciated by their kin, Despair built Ennui for the other lost and wandering souls of the worlds. It is the darkest, the most feared by those in the [[Domain - Mundane]] world who paint horror stories thanks to the nightmares spun by Dream. Behind his dark veil, Despair hides the monsters of the world, giving them a place to wallow and to plot until [[Domain - Oraculum]] determines the Weave is ready for their thread again. 

### Necropolis

A literal ghost town, Despair rules his domain from this city of the dead. 

### Hellocke

A lake of hellfire, this is where most of the devils spawn into existence and where some wade for repentance. Dive deep enough and you'll find your way into the Terrors of Reverie. 

### Whispering Wood

A mist-filled forest that is meant for the hopeless and souls unwilling to move on, it is connected to the Raven's Wood in Fortuna. 

### Endless Waste

A desolate wasteland that connects to the Boundless Shade of Oraculum. 

### Crypt of Contrition

A haunting place where those who dwell are not expected to return their thread to the Weave by choice.
