## Summary

This session began with the party bearing witness to the final rite of the Order of the Grim initiate, Thalion. However, things quickly devolve as Wolf gets too close to the ring and the creature - this specter of the Void - catches whiff of him and quickly shifts its focus onto Wolf. The Masters have to call the rite, forcing the Void back into the rift end ending before Thalion's full initiation is complete. Zephyr joins the group to discuss what happened and expression confusion, however through all of this, Wolf seems proud to have been recognized. That pride continues into a fit of hysteria as the Void springs forth a rift of its own and joins the group with two other monster as well, forcing them into battle. During the fight, Wolf goes down and is swallowed by the Void. Auden, with more quick thinking, manages to dive in after him and then Dimension Doors them back to the group and the remainder of battle but not before seeing threads of arcane energy weaving through the forest. As soon as he lands back in the room, he hears a female voice in his head, telling him he did well. In the end, it's Invidious who brings the Void down but in the ending of the creature, they're all sucked into the black hole and teleported into a misty forest. After some quick inspection, Alina deduces that they're back in Ennui, on the other side of the river, as some ravens fly overhead. Auden, on the ground, spies the threads again and finds the entrance to the hedge maze, as if it beckons him further.
