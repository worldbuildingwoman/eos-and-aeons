*Tw: Harm to animals*

As the early morning hours began, we cut in on a sleeping Phinneas. Hoping that Laila's potion would do him some good, only to find himself in the throws of more violent visions - and what he hopes isn't a premonition - he awakes screaming with the fading image of Morielle being burned alive in a fissure of lava. Wolf is already awake, studying his book by the moonlight and is watching Phinneas as the cleric quickly sits up. The screams wake the women in the camp as well, as they all come running to check on their visitors. Once everyone is convinced Phinneas is safe, they begin the morning early enough with Wolf and Alina heading off ahead of Andrei to start checking the traps. In total, they find four traps with animals, the last of which has a fox who is still thrashing slightly. Alina, mercifully puts it out of its misery before saying a silent meditation of thanks to the forest and the fox. During this, the grass entangles around her foot momentarily as if to acknowledge it before the pair set off back to the camp. Morielle has risen fairly early, set upon working on his new armor. Phinneas finds him busy tanning the leather and cutting up the rough breastplate for rivets. His intention is to turn it into studded leather. Phinneas sits down to help by feeding the fire with his new found firebolt, and shares his dream from the night before. Morielle does his best to console his friend but can't help but feel a little frustrated by the man who has more knowledge, albeit confusing knowledge, than he himself has. Together, they throw back some booze before Laila shows up to fetch them for breakfast. Intent upon getting answers, Morielle tries to bargain with her. He offers to try and find whatever is kidnapping and hurting travelers in exchange for answers. Laila is aloof at best but says she'll consider before heading toward th emain group with the men following. The only one missing seems to be the Baronness who had disappeared in the night. Andrei, upon hearing that Morielle is in need of some armor, brings him into their storage where they have bits and things that traveler's trade for a night's stay. He passes on some equipment, including hide armor a light crossbow and a shortsword, for Morielle. As the group contemplates their plan and what they'd like to do, it becomes clear to Alina's family that she's likely to be leaving with the others. There's plenty of heartfelt goodbyes and promises of vengenece towards Morielle and Phinneas if they don't look out for her, before some more equipment is exchanged and the party sets out in search of whatever it is that haunts the Wilds, promising to return for answers and with answers of their own.
