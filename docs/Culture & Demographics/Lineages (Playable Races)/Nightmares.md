_(Based on Changeling 5e and a homebrew Nightmare.)_ 

Where there are dreams, there are nightmares. Beings of shapeshifting ability that can adopt any face they’d like and prey upon the dark thoughts of others. Not originally [[Dream]]’s intent, they remain in his domain under his protection and still serve their purpose.

### History

Nightmares are one of the beings of Eos that were created more out of evolution than original intent. Dream had always indulged in his chaotic endeavors but it was Despair and other beings of repressed emotion that led to a dream mutating into a nightmare. During the war leading up to the divergence, Dream had sent a wisp down to one of the elven settlements to bring hope and light to their trance meditations. [[Despair]], spying his brother’s attempt to raise morale amongst the first iteration of mortality, used their abilities to accentuate the feelings of hopelessness and misery in the creatures. When the muse returned back to Dream at his castle, it was no longer the creation he’d intended. Dark and brooding, it took on a spiderlike form that scared many in the castle that day. Dream, however, would not turn it away. Instead, he embraced the nightmare – a collaboration between two brothers who very rarely saw eye to eye – and welcomed it into his protection. He let it live freely, though observed it carefully and saw what it was capable of. Every night when the nightmare would approach a sleeping individual, Dream could see how much grief and anxiety it brought them. In the morning, after the wisp had fled back to Reverie, still the person was afraid. Dream pondered this and the following night, instead of letting the nightmare return, a dream wisp made the visit and Dream watched as the sleeping individual slept more soundly than they had in a month. Whatever the nightmare had shown them, gave them new appreciation for the good that the dreams would bring. And so, nightmares found their purpose in Reverie.

### A Hidden Terror

While they are not innately evil, nightmares do feed off of the fear, terror, and paranoia that they cause, and so they seek to spread it whenever they can. Sometimes this is on a small scale, othertimes a larger one. Even in their glamoured Mundane forms, there is a subtle wrongness to them that people might feel. In their true form, nightmares are spindly creatures made of darkness, this is why most have adopted 2-3 personas that they wear when they need to avoid detection. 

### In the Mundane

Since their creation, nightmares have been sent out in the Mundane to prey upon the repressed emotions of sleeping creatures. They prefer to travel at night, where they are less easy to detect, however they might also move around during the day, disguised as one of their personas.

**Shapechanger:** As an action, you can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can’t duplicate the appearance of a creature you’ve never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. Your clothing and equipment aren’t changed by this trait. You stay in the new form until you use an action to revert to your true form or until you die. 

**Nightmare Instincts:** You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Insight, Intimidation, and Persuasion. 

**Unsettling Visage:** When a creature you can see makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. You must use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits or misses. Using this trait reveals your shapeshifting nature to any creature within 30 feet that can see you. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. 

**Fearborne:** Nightmares fear nothing, but are feared themselves. This gives them advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Additionally, when in their true form, nightmares have resistance to psychic damage.
