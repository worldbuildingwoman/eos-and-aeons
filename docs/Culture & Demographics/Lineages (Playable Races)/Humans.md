_(Based on Humans 5e.)_ 

Amongst their own, humans considered apex predators and the smartest species in [[Country - Landrus]]. However, when compared to the other beings of Eos, they are neither the strongest nor the smartest. However, their ability to adapt and reproduce makes them a formidable force in the world. Perhaps it is a sideeffect of their mortality that they strive to make such change in such a short period but it is most certainly for this reason that the other aeons and their creations are fascinated (or disgusted) by them. 

### History

In the aftermath of the Divergence, when what was left of Eos was the broken pathways to the aeon domains and the grayspace of the Mundane, the first humans began to emerge. They crawled out of their caves and began building huts and villages. They gathered and hunted, having no big impact of the state of the world. However, one day, the elves of [[Domain - Reverie]] were exploring the dreamscapes and found themselves teleported into the [[Domain - Mundane]]. It was there they first witnessed these new beings, so similar to themselves but different. The humans who first saw them thought them to be gods, especially when they disappeared to report back to [[Dream]]. From that point on, the aeons became quite curious about the life that had been created in their absence. [[Destiny]]’s last gift before disappearing. Unike the elves, the humans had been created by Destiny alone. They held no magic or any real awareness of it. The aeons watched in fascination but eventually, they wanted to test out a theory. Could they introduce subtle changes or influences that would allow the humans to flourish. Dream entered their minds while they slept, filling their thoughts with ideas of the impossible. [[Fortune]] saw the chance to alter some fortune and test out theories of balance. [[Despair]] saw only those who suffered and considered them to be more souls to keep him company. All the while, the humans had no idea of the influences outside of themselves. Years past and their population grew. Along with it trade and industry sprung up. Villages turned into towns that turned into cities. Now, humans cover the Mundane, building and inventing and making every second of their (comparably) short lives count. 

### Persevering and Curious

Aeons have noted humans as being the most adaptable and persevering of the creations. They latched onto the influence of the aeons and ran with it, turning Dream’s suggestions into full creations of their own. Their population is also as diverse in personality as it is in physical appearance. While not fully aware of the Aeons and their purpose, there are some who have encountered creatures from the other domains and made legends out of them. Creatures of folktale and the gods of old. 

### In the Domains

All humans originate from the Mundane, but that isn’t to say they all stay there. Some have happened through the passageways into other domains but rarely do they make it back without having been affected by their journey. Because of their high adaptability, humans are susceptible to the magics of the other realms and if they spend long in any of them, they begin to take on the traits of that domain. This usually depends on the length of stay, the interactions they have, and the trouble they get into. However, at the end of every human life, they eventually are gathered upby the reapers, brought before Time, judged by Fortune, and dispersed into their next phase of life. Whether or not that was Destiny’s plan remains to be seen.
