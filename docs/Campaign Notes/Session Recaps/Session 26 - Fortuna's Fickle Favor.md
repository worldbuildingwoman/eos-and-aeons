## Summary

The party awoke in Fortuna with some varying degrees of luck settling in around them, however, it's Wolf that has the worst misfortune as he's accosted on his way back from the bathroom. The elves from the tavern - the siblings he stole from - had tracked down the book and were intent on getting it back. Wolf feigned ignorance and started shouting to draw attention to them which brought the party out. Tensions were high as Wolf and Jacques tussled but in the end, cooler heads prevailed the the group managed to talk it out from the safety of Individious' room. Leona made it clear that Invidious could not be in possession of his own book but that if there was information they needed from it before it was returned to the Study of Spokes, that another in the party could read it. Phinneas was the one to do so and through the passages, they party learned that it was Invidious' sister, Codica aka Greed aka Masmirred who had taken the coin as well as his knives and left him for dead in the Mundane. The party, along with Leona, tried to put some of the pieces together as to why the vampirates would have stolen the book, who they were stealing it for, and what the keycoin could possibly be used to unlock but by the end you were still opperating on theories and relinquished the book to Leona who promised to get it to Oraculum safely, with Wolf's help. The rest of the party plotted over breakfast of what they might be able to offer Codicia in exchange for the keycoin.
