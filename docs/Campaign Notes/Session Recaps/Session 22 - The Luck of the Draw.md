## Summary

We picked up with Phineas seemingly without his memories until a conversation with Invidious pulls him out of it. He says that he might have gotten lost between the two versions of himself. Wolf, Alina, and Carmilla, try and process in their own way. The group talks about where they want to go next, finally settling on Fortuna. Before they head out, Wolf, finds a hidden passageway that leads him to a little cache of items, avoiding the massive fissure in the room that could have led to something nasty. They head out to go back to the Necropolis, trying to put together everything they know and formulate a plan. Invidious warns the party about his brothers, specifically Fierte. Invidious and Wolf make a bet of who can get the best loot from pickpocketing people in Fortuna. They walk into the Soul Gardens, and Invidious convinces his brother, Lussuria, to use the portal to Fortuna. Lussuria gets a few comments in about Masmirred and Invidious' bastard before they leave. Once in the capital city of Edith, Alina spies Yelle and AuTee. Invidious weighs the idea of robbing her, but considering her status as a Valkyrie and being on her home turf, they decide to stick to their plan for now and consider asking her for help later. The group goes through their pickpocketing bet while Carmilla and Auden watch. Wolf and Alina win and the group divvies up their loot before heading off further into Edith.
