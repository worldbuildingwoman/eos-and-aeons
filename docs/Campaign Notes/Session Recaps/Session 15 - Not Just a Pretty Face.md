## Summary

Tired from a near impossible fight with a purple worm, half the party focused on its harvesting ventures before joining Carmilla and Auden at Lolligag's side. Ahead of the party joining, Auden asked a few questions of the nothic including where he might find Destiny and the Order of the Grim. Neither answer was very helpful, but the group did at least get a semi-rough location for the Order of the Grim - which was repeated to Wolf later, when the monk asked the Nothic about it as well. For the rest, Morielle was the other individual to receive a cryptic message, one that focused on his missing memories and a hint at something else he lost - Resentment and Bitter Pain. With nothing else to ask, the group let Lolligag go and had Yelle lead them to the cave where she claimed to have awoken the abberation giant with AuTee. Here, the players attempted to take their rest. Auden began ritually detecting magic in the hopes of finding some hint as to where the giant had come from, while Carmilla took her space, Phinneas napped. Yelle, Morielle, and AuTee took first watch during which it was a painful first hour of the group having to listen to their flirting but before the watch could close, Yelle attempted to cast *Command* on him and it was only when it failed that the group was alerted to the fact that she wasn't who she claimed. AuTee and Yelle immediately went on the offensive, attempting to capture Morielle, while Xixy warned Auden not to interfere. As the fight broke out, they nearly made it away, with Auden's quick thinking against Yelle's celestial heritage but an unfortunate misunderstanding from Phinneas as he was waking up broke the effect, allowing Yelle to grab Morielle and AuTee and planeshift. Wolf was the only one near enough to grab onto Morielle as he too was pulled away in the blink of an eye. While the rest of the party stood angry and flabbergasted by what had just happened, with xixy admitting she knew it was going down - had even offered Morielle up to spare Auden's bounty - Morielle and Wolf land themselves in a vibrant and multi-colored place - the city of Edith in Fortuna.
