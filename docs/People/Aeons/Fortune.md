**Alias(es):** Lady Luck

Fortune, also known as the Lady of Luck, resides in Fortuna and her hall of judgment. Usually a neutral party, Fortune's ability to bestow both good and bad luck was so sought after that Despair attacked her beings first, thus making her an immediate party in the Dread Wars. Allied with Dream and later, Time, she fought against Despair because she believed he had always been jealous of the others and would not accept that their lot in life was not meant to be a good one. After the Divergence, with her sister, Destiny, missing, Fortune took over the role of interpreting the Weave and a creature's next life after their death.
