Chaos incarnate, Dream is the Aeon who spends most of his time walking in the realms of others. His favorite past time is pranking his siblings through their dreams and it seems no amount of time passing can relieve him of this. It is most often Dream's antics in harassing his twin, Despair, that cause the strife between Aeons. Most notably, when he caused Despair to fall into an endless sleep for 100 years before the others intervened. This led to Despair's outrage and eventually the Dread Wars. Since the Divergence, Dream still winds his way between realms using the dreamscape. It was the elves of [[Domain - Reverie|Reverie]] that first stumbled into the Mundane, giving Dream access to it. From there, Dream seeks to explore other realms through their dreams and nightmares.
