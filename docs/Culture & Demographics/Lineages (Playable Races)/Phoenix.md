_(Based on the Arakocra 5e.)_ 

The phoenix of [[The Multiverse - Eos]] are creatures of Time, tethered to a cycle of rebirth, they represent that which almost all beings of Eos must go through. However, where most are reincarnated into a different being, phoenix are reborn from their own ashes. They serve Time by being omens of an honorable death. 

### History

Time has always needed messengers of death for Eos. After beginning with the [[Reapers]], it was suggested that beings might prefer something less terrifying than a dark visage. Seeing the glorious wings of Fortune’s [[Valkyrie (wip)]], they create the phoenix. Tall and covered in fiery plumage, the phoenix became that sign. Similar to the reapers, they move through the domains, showing themselves to those whose time may be reaching an end. During the Divergence, however, the phoenix developed a much deadly purpose. Rather than just omens, they became fiery heralds, raining down on settlements as Time’s warriors. In the aftermath, the phoenix retreated into their mountains and showed themselves to few people. Since then, few phoenix have traveled to the [[Domain - Mundane]], so a sighting is rare. 

### Confident but Ashamed

Originally intended for good, their role in the Divergence left many phoenix ashamed of what they had done. While death is part of the cycle of life, and none know it better, as a species, they didn’t like that they had been used to stop a life that might have kept going otherwise. These days, phoenix tend to be aloof creatures or neutral if they find themselves in an adventuring party. However, when they do spot someone whose death is imminent, they tend to take on a caretaker role until that flame is snuffed out. 

### In the Mundane

Due to their history, phoenix in the Mundane prefer to take on a less obtrusive rule as a death omen. Those who do travel to the Mundane (and it is a rare thing) are usually disguised in a human persona as helping out at temples or hospital wards. They help souls to cross over without exposing themselves.
