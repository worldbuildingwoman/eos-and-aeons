## Summary

The session began with Alina and Phinneas heading to the Pegasus' Roost to meet up with Carmilla and Morielle. However, on the way, they are stopped by a loud trumpeting and when they go to investigate, they find a declaration being given - the Lady Fortune will be in attendance at the next council meeting to hear all concerns placed before them by the citizens of Fortuna. Alina overhears that this is the first time in 100 years that Fortuna has attended one of these and they surmise that's too much of a coincidence. They continue on and eventually meet up with Morielle and Carmilla who are busy talking with Niamh. After some questions, Niamh points him towards Yelle for help with the necklace and the twins for info about the leprechauns and Ed. When Phinneas walks in and Niamh sees him though, she's sent into a fury and drags him back outside in an attempt to hide him. The party learns this is because she was supposed to have been on a mission to kill all of the phoenixes and claimed to have succeed. Phinneas' existence proves otherwise and labels her a traitor. She ends up helping the party with a little more armor before agreeing to take them to Oraculum where she knows of a powerful enough spell caster - who she reveals to be Phinneas' sister. They explain that they'd like to hear more about what Fortune's meeting is though and Niamh says it could be a clever distraction for them to sneak through the Hall of Numbers. Agreeing to meet near the hollyphant fountain in the morning, the party heads off in search of some magic items and Niamh heads off on her own. We left off with the party heading towards Lucky's Bazaar.
