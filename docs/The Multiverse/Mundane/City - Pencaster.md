The city of Pencaster is a hub nestled at the crook of Lake Laventh. It’s a populated city and suburb with approximately 130,000 people and represents a main travel destination as well as a trade and commerce center that is connected to the rest of Landrus by waterways, trains, and air travel. Comparable to a Victorian age London, Pencaster is constantly changing and on the rise. Lake Laventh is fed by a tributary of the River Trax and in turn feeds the River Coth at its southern tip, which heads southeast towards other parts of Landrus.

### Demographics

The population of Pencaster, and Landrus as a whole, is human, or human-passing individuals who do not draw attention to themselves. Visually, it is a diverse population and is reflected across all lifestyles and occupations. The majority of the population is in the workforce or unemployed, with only 3% of the population making up the upper echelon of society.

### Government

Each region is managed by a council. A group of elected officials who represent their constituents in the decision-making process. The laws of Pencaster are made by the Council and enforced by the Wardens aka the City Guard. Laws which every citizen is expected to adhere to are as follows: 

1.  Crimes against the city: Arson, brandishing weapons without due cause (self-defense), espionage, fencing stolen goods, forgery, hampering justice, pollution or poisoning of natural resources, theft, treason, and vandalism.
2.  Crimes against citizens and officials: assault, blackmailing, burglary, damaging property or livestock, disturbing the peace, murder, robbery, slavery, impersonation, and fraud..
3.  Crimes against business and commerce: forgery, fraud, pollution or poisoning, espionage, theft, vandalism, and arson..

Punishments for breaking these laws are handed out through a trial where a jury of peers will find the defendant guilty or not guilty, and the Council will pass judgment on anyone found guilty. Punishments can include any of the following: exile from Pencaster into the Wilds (the fae realm), imprisonment in the penitentiary, hard labor, fines, damages, or an edict (forbidding them to do something at the risk of a harsher punishment.)

### Defences

The city’s defenses include the City Watch, a group comprised of officers and guards who train and patrol regularly. They’re under the jurisdiction of the Council and are tasked with keeping the peace and the city borders safe from attack. With Lake Laventh, a portion of the city guard is also trained in naval combat and patrols the lake and river.

### Industry & Trade

Pencaster’s primary industries are manufacturing and fishing, utilizing the lake for power. It has several factories that help produce manufactured goods, water transports, and new aerial designs. The monetary system uses “marks” which are made of gold, silver, and copper. 100 coppers makes a silver, 100 silver makes a gold, and 100 gold makes you a very well-to-do person about town. Someone living in squalid conditions might get by on 1-2 coppers a day; the poor would see 1 silver; the middle class with 1 gold; the wealthy with 4 gold, and the aristocracy thrives at 20 gold a day at minimum. 

### Technology

Led by the inventors of the Avant-garde, technology in the mortal world falls into the category of steampunk fantasy. Primary modes of transportation are trains, carriages, zeppelins, and boats. The elite of the world may have access to an early motorcar, but they’re not prevalent around the city yet. Letters are still the main way to communicate, but early telegraphing systems also exist.

### Districts

Broken up into several districts, Pencaster is a diverse city and home to many different lifestyles. The wealthiest neighborhoods are at the center of the city, surrounding the Quorum. The Red Harbor, North District and Stone Crossing are also considered wealthier neighborhoods. The Timber Reach is one of the main roads in and out of town and also houses the air fields for zeppelins. West Way is considered to be a respectable district, although with the working district of Fog Harbor. The East District and High Cliff are the outskirts and gullies of town. Those who cannot afford to live within the city walls find their homes amongst the factories and the fields.

#### The Quorum District

The government sector and aristocratic center of Pencaster. 

#### Fog Harbor

The west side of the harbor, home to the fishing docks and industry ports, as well as the rumored headquarters of the Hallowhands. 

#### Westway

A district that sits both within and without the city walls, it is the middle class district and a diverse region of the city. 

#### Red Harbor

The private harbor meant for passenger ships and vessels of the elite few. It is guarded at all hours by the Wardens. 

#### North District & Stone Crossing

A smaller district, this area of the city is filled with the artificing shops and tinkers, and is considering a middle class neighborhood. 

#### Timber Reach

The northern most outskirt of Pencaster, this is a sparsely populated area and houses more warehouses and the air fields for zeppelin landing. 

#### East District & Highcliff

The manufacturing and farming communities of Pencaster, sitting outside the city walls.

### Guilds and Factions

Pencaster has various trade guilds and organizations through it, but the following are the primary groups you can get involved with: 

#### The Council & Wardens

This is the group of elected officials and their supporters who believe in taking care of Pencaster over anything else. They have varying agendas both personal and professional they’re trying to accommodate but overall, their goal is to keep Pencaster vibrant and thriving. Within this group is the wardens, or the city guard, who watch over the city and keep the peace. They work from and reside around a district in the city called the Quorum. Their symbol is a hexagonal knot with a shield and ruby-red diamond at the center. 

#### Coldbrows

This is the manufacturing worker’s union. They fight for fair pay and better working conditions, often working for and against the Council to bring better working conditions to the populace of Pencaster. They are made up of working-class citizens and have little trust in the wealthy. They're primary focused in the East District. Their symbol is a double-walled rectangle with an ice-blue flame at the center. 

#### Avant-garde

This is the guild of inventors whose work is founded in the advance of technology and sometimes in the lost arcane ways. The artificers of the world, they are misunderstood by many and feared by some but ultimately, they want to push humans into a future that the Mundane can’t possibly fathom. They gather in the North District. Their symbol is two jagged, crossed lightning bolts surrounded by three diamonds. 

#### Hallowhands

This is the thieves guild that, much to the council’s disdain, has a large following within the city. Their allegiance is to their own and they don’t care to get involved with the politics of Pencaster unless it suits their own purposes. They meet in secret, have developed their own language, and are professionals at evading the law. They also have specific knowledge of how to get in and out of the Wilds and the fae realm, but keep that information for themselves. They're headquartered in Fogharbor. Their symbol is a palm split down the middle in a light and dark contrast.

### Geography

Pencaster is a city nestled at the base of Lake Laventh. With the lake and Frozen Wastes to the North, it has great natural barriers to any advances that might be made from hostile invaders, but through the rivers, the lake, and air transport, it’s easy for Pencaster to remain a center for trade even with these geographical features.

### Climate

It has a temperate climate that sees all four seasons.
