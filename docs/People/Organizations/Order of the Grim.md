This is the monk order that Wolf's real father, [[Caspian Void]] belonged to.

DM Secrets: In reality, the monks have an intense practice of meditation and focus that allow them to tap into their own inner shadows and darkness, harness their ki, and use that to enhance their abilities. It has nothing to do with Despair and it's only that they believe it is only in the feeling of despair that hope can bloom.

Not much is known about the Order of the Grim. Historically, they're referred to as a group of "spiritual zealots" that have branched off of the theological teachings of the Clerics of the Grave, and instead focus on harnessing the grim feelings of [[Despair]] themself. It's rumored that they're able to tap into the shadow of Despair and allows them to channel that into strength, speed, and agilty, sometimes even magic regarding the control of fog and shadows. This has earned them the moniker of Shadowdancers.

The location of their temple is currently legend. There are rumors of how to get to it from the Necropolis but only one creature (Lolligag) other than the monks themselves know, and his knowledge comes at a steep price.
