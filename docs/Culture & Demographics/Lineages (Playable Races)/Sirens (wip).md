**Creature:** Humanoid 
**Size:** Medium 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. 
**Languages:** You speak Common, Aquan, and one other language of your choice. 
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma increases by 2 and your Strength increases by 1. 

**Born From the Deep:** Adapted to even the most extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment. 

**Amphibious:** You can breathe air and water. You can cast Alter Self on yourself at will using this feature, only to turn your tail into legs, or your legs into a tail. When you do so, it lasts indefinitely and doesn't require concentration. 

**Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray. 

**Siren's Allure:** You have resistance against being charmed, since you yourself know and are proficient in all the tricks of a charmer. Likewise, you also have proficiency in Deception, and advantage on Performance and Persuasion checks made with your voice. 

**Songs of Sorrow:** You were blessed with a set of magical vocal chords. As an action, you may perform one of the following abilities: You sing a song that enraptures the mind. You can spend an action to force a number of creatures - up to your Charisma modifier - who can hear you to make Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are Charmed and will use any means available to them to move as close to you as possible. If they succeed, they will react to your singing as normal. Charmed creatures will vehemently resist any attempts to stop them, although they won’t harm other creatures intentionally. If a charmed creature is harmed, they can repeat the saving throw, snapping out of the charm on a success. You must continuously sing as if you were concentrating on a spell, but you do not have to sing anything in particular, allowing you to sing words and verbal components of spells without consequence. You let out a violent scream that breaks the eardrums of anyone who hears it. All creatures in a 15 ft cone in front of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 thunder damage, be deafened for 1 round, and be pushed 15 feet away from you. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is not deafened or pushed. After using this ability, your throat becomes too sore to speak, scream, or sing until the end of your next turn. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. You can use these actions a total number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain all uses after finishing a long rest. The DC for these abilities is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier.
