## Summary

After some more investigation at the bar, including finding out some of Phinneas' history and relationships with the bar owner, the party finds themselves momentarily split. Alina and Phinneas head into the back where they quickly realize that the main taproom is under some sort of time manipulation. They head further into the brewery and find a room filled with mirrors - a puzzle - that upon learning more about, realizes it has its consequences for solving. After a rather close call with a doppleganger, Alina heads out to the taproom to try and bring Morielle back. In the mean time, Morielle has been having a time with the bard out front. And after a successful slight of hand, manages to paralyze him but make it look like he's just passed out from exhaustion or something, and he steals his lute. After Alina collects him, they head into the back again where Morielle's stupor from the time magic is shook off and they're able to proceed further with the mirror puzzle. Realizing that the mirrors are based off of the sins - they begin to track down the final mirrors and end up in the main brewery room where it is stiflingly hot and a large beer elemental has been drawn out of the brewing tanks.
