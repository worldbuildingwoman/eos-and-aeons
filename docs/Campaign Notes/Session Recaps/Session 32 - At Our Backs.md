## Summary

As the group attempted to leave Cera's and begin the journey back to Tempor, they were immediately set upon by Sevastyan and his group of mercenaries, intent on capturing Niamh and them as well. A fierce battle, the group was nearly out of resources, so Alina tried to head back to Cera to get help when a vision interrupted -- Dream offered his help and Alina gladly accepted. Dream opened rifts in the world, and nightmares reached out to pull several of the mercanaries from the battle, as Cera and Danarune emerged to help as well. With this, the party was able to make the final blow, killing Sevastyan and the rest of them. But not before Sevastyan gave a clue that he'd been working for Fortune the whole time. Exhausted and a little shaken, they take a moment to catch their breathe and figure out what to do next.
