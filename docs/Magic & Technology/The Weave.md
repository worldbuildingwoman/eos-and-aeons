This is the word used to identify magic and the connection to all creatures. It's the pure energy the Aeons are made up of and what governs all things. It is through the threads of the Weave that a person's life(s) history is preserved. [[Time]] taps into the Weave as a means of recording history and deciding when one thread is ready to be cut and tied to a new thread, givng them new life. [[Fortune]] is considered an intrepreter of that Weave, able to see the past lives and transgressions to decide which life will be their next. This was originally [[Destiny]]'s role but with her sister's disappearence, Fortune has picked up the slack. [[Dream]]'s interactions with the weave exist more in the realm of creativity and chaos. They can see how much potential lies in every thread and thus brings that out in them. Meanwhile, [[Despair]] attunement lies in being able to read the emotions behind the magic. With every life or intention for power, there is emotion behind it.
