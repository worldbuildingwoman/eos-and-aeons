## Summary

Where their kin is mystical and ethereal, Oraculum sits as a pinnacle of order. For those from the realm of Time, there is no gray area, only that which is black and white. There is a beginning and there is an end, even for the Aeons, he will claim. Beings of time guard the cycle of life in the realms. They are not fate but rather the messenger who calls when the clock strikes. This realm is one of precise lines, gridded streets, and organization. Even their mist-filled forests are in neat rows. It is an unsettling atmosphere of certainty that does not always seem so welcome to those who do not understand it. 

### Taperkeep

From within the candle-like towers of the keep, Time governs. Each tower has a different emblem of time atop it, slowly passing the minutes, the main tower also functions as a sundial on the keep's courtyard. Altogether, they look like a candleabra in the sky. 

### Sands of Time

An ode to erosion and the constant redistribution of time in the cycle of life, they stretch into and begin to become one with the Sleeping Sands of [[Domain - Reverie]] 

### Study of the Spokes

The library of Time that has a center with several connecting halls, spiraling outward into various archives and even connecting to the Hall of Numbers in [[Domain - Fortuna]]. 

### The Boundless Shade

A region of escape from the cycle of time, it seems enticing at first but if you wander far enough, it will send you to [[Domain - Ennui]]. 

### Tempore

The origin of the elvish race, where the first mortals were permitted to remain in Oraculum and granted eternal life before venturing into other Aeon realms. Tempore is the city that surrounds the Candlekeep and houses most of the beings of Oraculum who choose to live in a populated area.

### Geography

Oraculum is a domain of time and logic, and this is reflected in the geography of the domain. Roads are not loose dirt nor gravel but cobblestone laid out in a precise path. While some areas are in need of repair, Time makes it a point to keep things well-maintained and orderly as is their preference. Since all of the domains retain the same general landmarks and geographical features, the mountains are reflected here as well.
