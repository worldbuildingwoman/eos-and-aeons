_(Based on Halfling 5e and a Leprechaun homebrew.)_

Leprechauns are perhaps the most widely know and trickiest of [[Fortune]]’s creations. Small and sprite, they are know for hopping between domains and sharing their good fortune with whoever is quick enough to catch them. That being said, just because they spread good fortune, doesn’t make them inherently good. 

### History

Leprechauns existed in the domains long before the divergence. Fortune, realizing she needed more help in terms of spreading her gifts to the world and keeping balance, created the leprechauns to be quick and cunning. It is their responsibility to guard the wealth-spring of fortune throughout [[Domain - Fortuna]]. Which is no easy task, given that the wealth-spring never stays in one place long. For this reason, leprechaun communities are nomadic, traveling in caravans with their kin. They go where fortune takes them, guarding and collecting it along the way. Their gifts give them the upperhand of tracking things down but many of the other creatures in the domains would love to get their hands on all of the good fortune the leprechauns guard, so they must be clever in hiding it as well. Each leprechaun clan as an elder who carries their traditions and histories with them, passing them down through stories to the next in line to wear the mantel. 

### Sprite and Cunning

A leprechaun’s energy and enthusiasm for their work is evident in every bit of height of their small bodies. They’re rarely over three feet tall, even in the Mundane, and they use their size to their advantage. Sneaking through crowds, dropping luck coins into the pockets of some and avoiding others. And their cunning doesn’t stop there. Leprechauns are improvisationists by nature because you never know when the wealth-spring might move again and they have to pack up and leave. In the Mundane While in the Mundane, leprechauns are most often mistaken for children or little people. They generally have no issue with this and continue to use it to their advantage. Their purpose is to spread good fortune around but sometimes the leprechauns find they just enjoy the Mundane and all of its odd people more than protecting the wealth-spring like their ancestors.
