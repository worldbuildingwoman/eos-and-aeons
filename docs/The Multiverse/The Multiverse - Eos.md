The multiverse of Eos, is made up of separate planes, referred to as realms, layered on top of one another, considered parallel dimensions that are traversable but only if you know how to read the weave. 

> “If you’re searching for it, you won’t find it. However, if you’re open to the concept of a world beyond your reality, than the aeon domains might decide you’re worthy of an invitation.”

 The way between worlds is a literal labyrinth of possibility and one is more likely to end up lost than found. Still, the way exists for a reason. Collaboration between the realms has been present for years. Sometimes tense other times more amicable. Each realm is ruled over by their Aeon, an ageless being who can never be killed or replaced they just _are_.

### Geography

Eos once was a single-layered multiverse that was built in collaboration by the Aeons. A wonderous world of varying topography, landmarks, it was shattered during the Divergence wars and now sits split between the five known domains - Oraculum, Reverie, Ennui, Fortuna, and the Mundane. With this split, the concept of magic seemed lost to the world, and thus the Mundane became just that. Void of magic, the land turned brown and dusty. Jagged mountains that were once crowned with cotton candy pink and blue clouds now are only encircled by white mist. The world itself is is split into continents with varying biomes but all of them remain plain and hazardous, as if the world would be better if traversed by magical means.

### Ecosystem

Although void of magic after the Divergence, there have been slow leaks developing over the course of the last 1800 years. The elves were the first to really make use of these, exploiting a leak until it became a portal, however elsewhere in Eos, there are spots where magic seeps through between domains, affecting the area and the ecosystem around it. For this reason, there are pockets through Eos that seem to flourish or suffer more than others, an effect that isn't always noticable to the general population of the various domains.
