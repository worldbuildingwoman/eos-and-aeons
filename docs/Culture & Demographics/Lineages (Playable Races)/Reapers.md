_(Homebrew based of the Shadar-kai 5e race.)_

Like most omens of death, Reapers are one of the more misunderstood creatures of Eos. A servant of [[Time]], they move between the domains as a psychopomp of souls. Whether it’s the Mundane or any of the other domains, it is generally a reaper's duty to shepherd beings to Fortuna and Oraculum to be judged and spun into their next life, whatever that might be. 

### History

When the domains were created by the Aeons and life began to evolve from what was created, Time found that there was a need for balance. Dream endless creativity and Despair’s deep-seated envy to keep up filled Eos with beings. Time suggested a limit on lifespans, creating mortality, though Fortune intervened and suggested randomness to death, as well as the chance to be returned to the world’s weave in some other way again. Thus, not all of the world’s creatures would live forever and for some, their lives were cut short by discontent or happenstance and would be returned to Fortuna and Oraculum to be recycled. For this reason, Time created the reapers. Death personified, they were tasked with traveling the realms to find creatures in their last moment alive. However frightening death might seem, the reapers can be a very charismatic lot. After all, it’s not easy to convince a soul to travel with you to their judgment day. 

### Self-Reliant and Focused

Because of their mission, reapers are a nomadic species, traveling with small clans among the domains to do their work. Some choose to branch off and live on their own, going about their business as usual or with their own perspective. However, all reapers return to Orcaculum and pass through Fortuna regularly to return the souls they have collected. Once a reaper reaches a certain number of souls, they can elect to be returned into the Weave as well for their next turn at life. 

### In the Mundane

 Even the Mundane needs shepherds of death, and as the prime being of that, reapers appear completely human when in the Mundane. By all visible means, they look just like humans.
 
**Creature Type:** Humanoid 
**Size:** Medium 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Ability Score Increase:** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. It's suggested to focus on Wisdomand Charisma. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20. 

**Strong Willed:** You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself. 
**Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Death Comes for Everyone:** Not everyone will come so easily to death's call, so reaper's have proficiency in persuasion and insight to help ease their role. 

**Psychopomp transference:** If a creature dies within 5 feet of a reaper, the reaper may choose to regain a hit die or spell slot of its choice. This trait may only be used once per long rest and is not applicable to constructs or undead. You may use this trait to regain a hit die one additional time per long rest when you reach 6th level, and again at 11th, 15th, and 18th level. 

**Scythe Specialty:** When used by a grim reaper, scythes are given the glaive stat block (with finesse), hand-scythes are given the rapier stat block (slashing damage), and sickles are given the scimitar stat block. You are proficient in these three weapons. Whichever you choose becomes your soul-collector (up to 30 souls at a time), tethering the souls you carry that must be returned to Oraculum or Fortuna.

**Geographic Distribution**: [[Domain - Oraculum]]
