**Pronouns:** He/him
**Job:** Bartender

Mordecai is a ghostly bartender serving in a ruined tavern in the Necropolis, where he caters to a crowd of vampires and other ghosts. He is a tall, thin figure with a gaunt face and a wispy white beard that reaches down to his chest. His eyes are a pale blue color that seem to glow in the dimly lit tavern.

As he serves drinks to his patrons, Mordecai's movements are slow and deliberate, as if he's moving through water. His mannerisms are calm and collected, as befits someone who has seen the world both before and after death. Despite his spectral nature, he exudes a sense of authority and confidence that commands respect from even the most unruly of customers.

In terms of speech, Mordecai speaks in a deep, raspy voice that echoes through the tavern. His words are measured and precise, often punctuated with a wry smile or a dry chuckle. He's not one for small talk, preferring instead to engage his customers in deeper conversations about the mysteries of the afterlife or the history of the Necropolis.

Despite his ghostly appearance, Mordecai is a well-respected figure in the tavern and the town at large. He's known for his ability to keep the peace between warring factions and his keen sense of intuition when it comes to identifying troublemakers. Whether you're a vampire or a ghost, Mordecai is always there to serve you a drink and lend a listening ear.
