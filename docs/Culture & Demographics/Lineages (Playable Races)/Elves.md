_(Based on the Eladrin Elves of 5e.)_ 

Elves are the first iteration of mortals in Eos. They are considered a bridge between the [[Domain - Mundane]] the various domains of Eos, serving as both advisors to the aeons and influencers in the mortal realm. The elves of Eos are gifted with abilities unique to their domain or origin. 

### History

Created just prior to the divergence, elves were proposed by [[Destiny]] as an attempt at collaboration amongst the other aeons. Intent on settling the unrest, the plan backfired and ultimately ended with the divergence and each aeon creating an elven subspecies of their own design. When Eos split, the elves were shunted to their new domains and served as a reminder to the aeons of their hubris and pride. Over the years however, as the Mundane began to grow into something new, elves became the key to allowing the aeons access to it. Though tied to their domain, it was the [[Domain - Reverie]] elves who first discovered their ability to travel between their domain the Mundane almost instantly. Eventually, word spread and the elves became scouts into the Mundane for each aeon, the emissaries, and advisors. Easily blending in with the [[Humans]] save for their ears, elves were the perfect sleeper agent for each domain. 

### Otherworldly and Curious

Through their close connection to their domain, elves have developed an otherworldliness that sets them apart. Whether it's in their physical appearance or demeanor, elves can seem unnatural graceful or intimidating to the Humans of the Mundane. Other creatures of their domains are equally as thrown off, given their original purpose and the subsequent divergence of the aeons. However, the opinions of others have little negative effect on elven curiosity and perseverance. Perhaps even the opposite. After the divergence, it was their natural curiosity that led to their discovery of travel between the domains and subsequently the rise in favor and purpose. It is this constituted drive that keeps elves at the forefront of the growing intervention between the domains of Eos and the Mundane. 

### In the Mundane

Elves in the Mundane are there to be the eyes, ears, and subtle influence of the aeons. They are the species that finds it the easiest to blend in with Humans but are also the most keen to see what the next evolution of mortals will bring about. 

### Subraces:

 

#### The Elves of Reverie

 **Perchance to Dream:** Elves of [[Domain - Reverie]] have harassed the ability of the Sleeping Sands. Once per long rest they can attempt to put a creature to sleep. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target become unconscious until the following morning or until they take any damage. Creatures who cannot be out to sleep by magical means are immune. 

#### The Elves of Oraculum

 **Second Chance:** Elves of [[Domain - Oraculum]] can assert their influence over the flow of time, specifically when it comes to the death of a creature. Once per day, as a reaction, an Oraculum elf can rewind the clock on a killing blow to an ally. The attacking creature must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the elf’s Intelligence stat, or they automatically miss on their attack. Only other creatures of the Oraculum domain can sense this shift in time. 

#### The Elves of Fortuna

 **Change the Odds (Portents reskinned):** Elves of [[Domain - Fortuna]] have the ability to shift the balance of fortune. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these fortune rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused fortune rolls. 

#### The Elves of Ennui

 **Shroud of Despair:** As a bonus action you, channel the atmosphere of [[Domain - Ennui]] into your immediate area. Creatures within five feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to your Charisma stat. On a failure, the creature is overcome by dread and despair, causing them to be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
 
**Size:** Your size is Medium. 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

**Aeon Touched:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. 

**Domain Denizens:** Elves hold a special connection to the domain or their origin. It is through this connection that an elf can cast teleportation once per long rest to jump between their domain and the Mundane. They cannot use teleportation to go anywhere else.
