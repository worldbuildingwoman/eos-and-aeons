Ghosts are one of the most prevalent lineages in the [[Domain - Ennui]]. They are souls who chose to continue living with the memories of their previous life but without any strong feelings towards it. They populate Ennui as heavily as Humans populate the Mundane. 

### History

 When it came to the creation of ghosts, [[Despair]] only really set out to offer creatures like himself somewhereto go. He knew that not everyone would be so quick to let go of their past and noteveryone was eager to dive into a world of dreams and "fairytales" as he frequently criticizes [[Domain - Reverie]] . Instead, ghosts became the building block of his domain. When the other denizens of Ennui sprang into being, the ghosts had to learn to adapt, but there was a bit of bitterness added to their new existence. Not only were they now in this desolate domain, clinging to ideas of their former lives but they were also the least "real" of all of Despair’s creations. They became restless at one point, causing a great deal of anguish for their aeon until he offered them a purpose: travel between the domains as they could, using their incorporeal forms to spy on the others. Especially Dream. Now, ghosts work closely alongside the [[Elves]] of Ennui to bring Despair the information about his siblings. That is, when they’re not staring mournfully off into the distance, wondering about their last moments. 

### Clinging to Life

 Unlike some of their angsty counterparts, ghosts are beings who are instead clinging to their past lives for one reason or another. Not necessary out of trauma or the idea of revenge (those would be better fit for revanents) but for some unfulfilled notion. Because of this, they spend most of their time on Ennui, populating the ruinious towns or villages, pretending that they’re still alive. Their appearance takes on influence from their death, letting them appear as they were but changing in color to fit the tone of their passing. (i.e. white for a peaceful death, red for death in fire, blue for drowning, etc.) 

### In the Mundane

 The Mundane is possibly the most exciting but also the hardest for a ghost to be part of. While in the Mundane, ghosts are completely invisible, they cannot be heard or seen except by other creatures of Ennui. However, they are still acutely tied up in the goings on of their previously lives and will sometimes find themselves in the Mundane, just living in the places they used to and trying to retain some attachment to their former lives.
 
**Creature:** Undead 
**Size:** Small to medium 
**Speed:** Your speed is 30 feet. You can hover 1 feet over the ground. If you end your turn more than 1 feet over the ground, you start falling. 
**Ability Score Increase:** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Follow this rule regardless of the method you use to determine the scores, such as rolling or point buy. Suggestions would be Charisma and Strength. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20. 
**Languages:** You can write, read and speak common and one other language of choice. 

**Undead Nature:** You are immune to the effects of Turn Undead. You do not require air, food, drink or sleep. You have resistance to poison damage, bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non magical weapons, being immune to poisoned and diseases. 

**Devil's Sight:** You have a special darkvision up to 120ft. Magical darkness doesn't impede the ghost's darkvision. 

**Withering Touch:** You have proficiency with your unarmed strike, and any damage dealt by it is necrotic damage. 

**Incorporeal Stride:** You can move through other creatures and objects other than walls (or ceilings) as if they were difficult terrain. Once per short rest, you may pass through up to 10 feet of solid walls (treating them as difficult terrain) as a part of your move action. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object or a wall, and are immediately ejected to the closest available space if within a wall. 

**Flight:** Starting at 3rd level, you gain a fly speed equal to half your walking speed, rounded up to the nearest 5 feet. At 5th level your fly speed equals your walking speed.

**Geographic Distribution**: [[Domain - Ennui]]
