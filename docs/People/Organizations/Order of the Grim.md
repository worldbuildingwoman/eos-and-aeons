Not much is known about the Order of the Grim. Historically, they're referred to as a group of "spiritual zealots" that have branched off of the theological teachings of the Clerics of the Grave, and instead focus on harnessing the grim feelings of [[Despair]] themself. It's rumored that they're able to tap into the shadow of Despair and allows them to channel that into strength, speed, and agilty, sometimes even magic regarding the control of fog and shadows. This has earned them the moniker of Shadowdancers.

The location of their temple is currently legend. There are rumors of how to get to it from the Necropolis but only one creature (Lolligag) other than the monks themselves know, and his knowledge comes at a steep price.

## History

The Order arose in the aftermath of the Dread Wars. For so many, their natures had been used as a weapon or turned against them. It was traumatic and unforgivable, yet these people had to find some way to carry on. They all turned to the Saints of the Grave, six individuals who had been raised to sainthood for their compassion and dedication to the Aeons. 

It was Saint Vespen who brought together the most, giving many a hope for a future they could not see with the Divergence. A future with purpose, one that could not be corrupted by the whims of the Aeons or even Destiny herself, however neutral she usually remained. And so the Order of the Grim was created - taking in individuals who no longer fit into the expectations of their existence. They were taught history and language, arcane and martial arts, all the while being given a home in a domain that was always meant for those who were misunderstood - Ennui.

The Order resides in secret because there are many who would seek to maintain the status quo. If not across the domains, then within each of them. The Seven seek to keep their place in the realms hierarchy. The valkyrie seek to continue imposing their judgment on souls awaiting their Renewal. The muses of dream continue to consider their best work that which brings people joy and laughter. Even Time, has been swayed to bias every once in a while, and while his constructs actively seek to archive and maintain than to influence, they are the first to be enraged when the system is disrupted.

Since the wars, the Order of the Grim has been the eyes of the world, keeping tabs on each of the domains and using their shadow traveling abilities to move between them more easily.

## A Secret Kept

In reality, the monks have an intense practice of meditation and focus that allow them to tap into their own inner shadows and darkness, harness their ki, and use that to enhance their abilities. It has nothing to do with Despair and it's only that they believe it is only in the feeling of despair that hope can bloom.

**Their motto:** "Life leads us down dark roads, but that is necessary to see the light."

**Their insignia:** A black circle with a pale crescent moon inside it

The Order has a ritual that its acolytes must go through to complete their training, where they face the Void through a magical initiation. *They enter the abyss through a psychic connection, allowing them to face their fears without fully facing the Void and its dangers. Caspian however, wanted to face the real Void and tracked it down himself.*

### Manual of Shadowwalking

Each member of the Order is encouraged to keep a journal. It's a practice in meditation, contemplation, and allows one to better understand their own being. The arcanaists can magically scribe in specific practices as a monk learns them, but they are encouraged to infuse their own notes and understandings into the pages.

Caspian's seems to have become more, and he'd recommend taking it to their arcanaists to better understand what it was. It's rare that they get passed down due to the secrecy, but because Caspian left his, he must have very much have wanted Wolf to have it. Or else, he planned on returning.

## Notable Figures
