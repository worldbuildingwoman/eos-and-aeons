## Summary

The session began on the road to the Endless Wastes. It was fairly quickly that a heavy fog set it, making travel dangerous and so Xixy, their NPC guide, decided to make camp, warning everyone about making noise as it would draw attention. While most of the party acquiesced, Morielle was in dire need of something normal and grounding and the only thing he wanted to do was work on his half-plate armor. Unfortunately, as the night progressed, the clanging drew in visitors. A fight ensued in which the party was attacked by several shadows, scarecrows, and will-o-wisps. Auden and Carmilla both went down but the party was able to bring them back up. However, in the midst of battle, in an arguement over Boggy's role during the fight, the boggle attacked Morielle and was then cast down by the rogue as he deemed the creature a threat to the party. After the creatures were defeated, a heated debate broke out in which everyone in the party was upset with Morielle, and even went so far as to attack him for what he'd done. Boggy was saved thanks to Phinneas but the group remains fractured by what has come to pass and it would seem that although he still does not fully remember who he is, the new-old Morielle is back.
