Mobius Scroll

Scroll, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

Unlike most scrolls having a dowel at its center or some means of a carrying case, a _mobius scroll_ is a half-twisted length of paper that's been magically connected to itself to form an infinite, continuous sheet.

The scroll is blank when found. A spell appears on it when you first attune to the scroll and then again daily at dawn; roll a d8 each time and use the table below to determine what spell is written on the scroll. On a 1 or 8, an extra spell appears on the scroll (as determined by the table). While you're attuned to the scroll, you can use a bonus action to shunt it to a special demiplane or summon it to your free hand. You can read from the scroll to cast a spell from it using an action.

|d8|Spell|Extra Spell|
|---|---|---|
|1|_Slow_; roll a second d8 and consult the Extra Spell column to determine what extra spell appears on the scroll.|_Rope trick_|
|2|_Call lightning_|_Bane_|
|3|_Hypnotic pattern_|_Bless_|
|4|_Spirit guardians_|_Disguise self_|
|5|_Dimension door_|_Magic missile_|
|6|_Fireball_|_Invisibility_|
|7|_Ice storm_|_Flaming sphere_|
|8|_Haste_; roll a second d8 and consult the Extra Spell column to determine what extra spell appears on the scroll.|_Pass without trace_|

You can cast a spell from the scroll as normal while you're attuned to it, even if that spell isn't on your spell list, using your spellcasting ability modifier, spell save DC, and spell attack bonus. Once a spell has been cast from the scroll, the ink in which it was written vanishes from the paper, and that spell can't be cast again until the next time it appears on the scroll. Any spell remaining on the scroll is replaced by the new spell or spells daily at dawn.

A spell that's copied from the scroll into a spellbook is permanently removed from the scroll. If that spell is rolled on the table above after it's been copied in this way, nothing happens, and the scroll remains blank until the next dawn.
