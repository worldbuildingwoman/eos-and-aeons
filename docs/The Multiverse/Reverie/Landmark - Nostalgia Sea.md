**Alternative Name(s):** Sea of Starlight, Sea of Memories, Raging Grief
**Owning Organization:** [[Idonian Sirens]]

An endless span of water made of pure starlight and memory, home to the Sirens and a treacherous place to those who are not at peace with their own past.

### Geography

The Nostalgia Sea is a large span of silvery water that seems, at first to be made of starlight. It shimmers endlessly both day and night but it's only upon closer inspection that one can see it's not made of stars but the same chaotic dream magic as the rest of Reverie. In its swirling iridescent depths lies treacherous currents of past grief and memory that can easily pull you under. Its shallow tide pools are hold the quintessential joys and contentedness of memories, and those who find themselves in the water might experience a taste of the past. While the sea does appear endless, some claim to have reached its end, both across or under it, and find that it leads them to someplace they were meant to be.

### Ecosystem

The waters of the Nostalgia Sea are ever changing. To some, they are cold and merciless while others find them more pleasant and warm. Regardless of what an individual feels when they touch the waters, it is home to plenty of creatures both big and small. Schools of magical fish with rainbow scales migrate north and south throughout the year. The sirens of legend swim through these waves, keeping a watchful eye over it for Dream.

### Localized Phenomena

The nature of the sea is the chance of a storm and none are so fierce as those over the Nostalgia Sea. Especially in the presence of deeply regretful or nostalgic individuals, those on a ship might find themselves in the midst of a hurricane. The waters of the Nostalgia Sea are this potent, and the smallest bit of unease can turn them. However, when used correctly, the waters can help individuals find closure and peace with their past as well.

### Climate

Most of the Nostalgia Sea and northern coast of Reverie is a balmy climate. Neither severe hot like the Sands of Time nor especially frigid, it keeps a comfortable temperature and an even breeze so long as the crew on board isn't hiding a deep, dark regret.

### History

After the Divergence, when [[Dream]] was traversing [[Domain - Reverie]] and learning about the magics of his new domain, he came upon the northern coast. By then, the water was already infused with the silvery swirls of starlight and iridescent galaxy waves. Dream stood on the beach, staring outward over the ocean, and felt a deep sense of loss after everything that had happened. He, like his siblings, had put so much of their energy and ideas into [[The Multiverse - Eos]] to have had it all ripped away. Their petty disputes, his and [Despair]'s in particular, was especially heavy on Dream's mind as he slumped down into the wet sand and let the seafoam lap at his feet. It was then that he felt the tug of the ocean waters. He rose slowly, wading out until he was up to his waist. Observing his reflection in the water, he watched as his passing thoughts and memories were mirrored back to him, filling him with regret and anger. Above, the sky began to reflect that energy and the ocean began to roil. For five days, Dream stood in the water, mesmerized by his own regrets and memories. When his loyal commander, [[Hulum Lunala]], found him, pulling him from the waters, Dream was despondent with grief. However, the moment he was pulled from the ocean, the waves began to settle and the storm subsided. The elven warrior took Dream back to where they had begun to build their capital of Dreamspire, but that volatile sea forever became known as the Nostalgia Sea and those who approach it are warned of its powers.
