_(Based on Satyrs 5e and a Muse homebrew.)_ 

The charismatic and ethereal Muses are legendary for the inspiration they offer others. Even in the Mundane, rumors of these beautiful beings travel as swiftly as their own songs. In them, [[Dream]] saw infinite inspiration which is only half of what he got… 

### History

One might think that the history of a muse is a question of “what came first, the artist or the inspiration?” But in this case, it was most certainly the artist. Dream, in his power of creation had spent centuries crafting the dreams and nightmares of other creatures. He brought them joy and sorrow, chaos and creativity, but not without a cost. In constant disagreement with his brother, [[Despair]], and perhaps even plagued by the emotion itself, Dream found himself in a lackluster state of creation. Everything he tried to spin was more of the same and it enraged him. It was Fortune who stepped forward, concerned for her brother and suggested he find something to inspire him again. Looking around at their world, he found he wanted other creatures who could create like he could. Beings who could play muse, write poetry, and ultimately fill the world with as much creativity as he strived for. Thus, the muses were born. However, like so many other creations of Dream, the muses have their catch-22. They are inspiring and beautiful but they also have a hunger for it themselves. They found that attaching themselves through a telekinetic link allowed them to enjoy the aura of creation that surrounded an artist when they were working. Dream, finding no issue in this, let them continue and it has become a symbiotic relationship for a muse to have artists to patron. 

### Create and Consume

Muses make naturally talented artists and musicians. The muses of old were said to have entertained Dream himself in Dreamspire. However, after the Divergence, muses found that their own creativity mattered less than that of other creatures. They live now to inspire others and to find a host for their symbiotic relationship. Muses want to both create and consume – music and art, not other people, you goon. 

### In the Mundane

In the Mundane, muses have found a plethora of creators to turn to. Their inspiration, when paired with a gift from Fortune, can be especially potent but they do find that their gifts work best when maintained on a small group or just a few artists of their selection.
 
**Creature:** Humanoid 
**Size:** Medium
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Charisma increases by 2, and your Wisdom increases by 1. 
**Languages:** You can speak Common, Elvish, and one other language you decide. 

**Magic Resistance:** You have advantage on saving throws against spells. 

**Reveler:** As an embodiment of creation and artistry, you have proficiency in the Performance and Persuasion skills, and you have proficiency with one musical instrument of your choice. 

**Symbiotic Link:** You can speak telepathically to one creature with whom you have bonded. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. The creature cannot telepathically communicate back to you. You cannot be bonded with more than one creature at a time. You can bond with a creature as an action, but your existing bond with any creature is immediately severed. When you and the bonded creature are within 5 feet of each other, you each have advantage on saving throws. You can use this trait to take the Help action as a bonus action, targeting the bonded creature, and you can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Starting at 3rd level, until the start of your next turn, the first time the target of your Help action hits a creature with an attack roll, you regain a number of hit points equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus. 

**Symbiotic Trance:** Muses don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. While in this trance, you can dream after a fashion if you have established a telepathic bond with another creature; such dreams are actually the desires of the bonded creature. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep, and if you have established a telepathic bond with another creature you do not require food or drink, as you are sustained by the dreams of the bonded creature.
