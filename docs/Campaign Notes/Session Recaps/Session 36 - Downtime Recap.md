## Summary

In the days that followed the reappearance of the Ardensol Brewery, the party spent a few days getting their bearings again. Phinneas worked through the bureaucratic nightmare that comes with wanting to take possession of a wizard's tower that was neglected for 30-years, but also learning of a job board that is posted outside of the Pendulum's Path. Alina worked to make some helpful acquaintances around town in an effort to get more information out of the Study of Spokes about the keycoin and how it was used to entomb Dream, also looking for some knowledge about her family. Morielle also goes looking for information about his sister, Codicia, and in turn finds out information about Victor Varnoth (Wolf's mom's affair) and Viktor Bloodthorne being the same person. The group makes some money turning the iron bits into weapons which they then sell, and when they go to do some shopping are accosted by a group of leprechauns sent by Ed. Before the mobsters can attack, they are taken out by a shadow monk who introduces himself as Oborozuki, and claims he's been on their trail looking for news of Caspian as well. Morielle eats four of the souls, and bullies the leader into a bargain for his soul in exchange for letting him live. In the meantime, he just has to spy on Ed for Morielle. They eventually make it to the Loose Screw, where they meet with Tanta Bellowflight who sells them some drugs, a +1 sheild, a scroll of Disguise Sell, a wand of conducting, a ring of ant control, and an amulet of rain detection. We ended with the players  still in the Loose Screw, considering their next steps.
