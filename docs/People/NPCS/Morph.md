> Excerpt from Session 0 As the lighting changes there's a shift in the theatre. It seems to grow a little colder as another actor steps out from behind the fountain. "Hello there, Xander." The voice seems to startle the boy as he falls back off the fountain, his boat discarded. "Don't be frightened. My name is Morph. I heard you say you didn't want to go with your mother." Xander seems confused but nods as a child might. "Parents are the worst, aren't they? They're always on about rules and schedules and lessons. Don't they know that there's so much fun to be had in the world?" As they say this, they do a front-hand-spring off the fountain and onto the stage. The atmosphere in the room seems to shift again as the lights turn to purple, blue, green, orange. Fading between and lighting up the stage in a miasma of rainbow light. "You want to know a secret? I can stop time. That five minutes you cleverly bargained for, I can make it last however long you'd like. Forever if you wanted! Would you like that?" they ask, balancing on their leg and doing a piroet. Their eyes whip around so as not to leave the other actor's for more than a second. "You can do that?" The actor Xander's eyes get big as he stares at Morph. "Absolutely. hehe" And with a snap of their fingers, the sound seems to echo through the theatre and the lights go out. A gasp from the audience is all you hear before the lights flicker back on the stage and on it now appears several ram like figures, their wool an iridescent sheen in the lights as they begin to trot across the stage. One jumps, bucks, and then he starts to run through the air, upward 5, then 10 feet. The crowd gasps again, and Xander seems to laugh with glee. The pair continues, Morph showing off their acrobatics as the rams get closer and seem to dance with him. The boat forgotten, Xander's full attention on the other actor. And then suddenly, he freezes. His eyes go wide with terror as he looks in your direction, Morielle, to something off stage. He seems to freeze and then reaches for his head and crumples to the floor. "What's wrong?" you hear Morph ask before they wheel around to stare at the space Xander had looked at and quickly diverts their gaze, hissing. "You."

Morph is an entertainer with the theater troupe at the Pencaster Theater in the Westway. A character in Alexander Maximoff's play, they are one of the first magical individuals that the party encounters when the night terror attacks the theater.

Using their dream elf magic, Morph put the party to sleep and somehow rewound time to make them start the day over again. When questioned about it on the second iteration, Morph is less than helpful so the party finds their answers through Ursula instead.
