**Date:** 6/20/24
**Primary location:** Phinneas's Tower, Tempor, Oraculum

## Summary

Having made it through the mirrors, the party ascends further into the tower, wary of what they might encounter. It's a treacherous climb up some 400 feet but eventually they make it to a doorway with glowing runes that are etched into the stone of a mountain. A voice greeted them, announcing they were speaking with the Structure for Assistive Magic and they needed to state their business. They do so, and convince the voice that it is actually Phinneas who has returned. Phinneas’s memories slowly unfold as he recalls various moments of his time here. He learns his own past lives were not so caring, and his engagement with the arcane arts led to some experiments where his other assistants died, thus the invention of the automaton, S.A.M., who was instructed to maintain the tower while he was away. They realize that in the last 30 years, S.A.M. has been trying desperately to keep things as they’re supposed to be in Phinneas’ absence. It is the automaton’s work that has the brewery stuck in a time loop and unable to escape, using Ryze’s talon to suspend them all and it was only Phinneas’ return into Oraculum that brought the brewery and the tower back.
