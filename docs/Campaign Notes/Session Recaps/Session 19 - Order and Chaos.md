## Summary

We picked up the session with Phinneas's experience in the tomb. It wasn't pleasant but it wasn't anything more than what he's used to seeing in his nightmares. Fast forwarding back down into the Order's hideout, the group was escorted to the Mess Hall - which was really just a few tables - and brought out some tea and refreshments. The tea was made of a magic flower similar to the one Bala had given Phinneas, and Zephyr explained that when steeped in cold water and consumed, it will remove a certain amount of exhaustion. While in here, they see a few of the initiatives in the corner who seem very interested in the newcomers but doing their best not to intrude. Zephyr goes on to explain more about the Order's history including how they were formed after the Dread Wars by Saint Vespen, and how it resides in secret to offer balance to the domains where others would seek to conquer and spread - like the Seven. It was shared that Caspian Void was one of their most prominent fighters and eyes in the world, that he fought Despair's first creation, Void, thus earning his name. The book Wolf possesses is also Caspian's personal journal and a practice amongst the Order, but it would appear Wolf's is special, for Caspian found out how to preserve some of his own ki into it, granting Wolf the boost to his abilities as he's learned from it. Prior to his disappearance or murder, Caspian was looking into the missing of Dream, not believing it to be Despair. After some careful prying and flashbacks of Morielle's, the party learned that Caspian believe Fortune to be involved somehow and Invidious was one of his sources, as the pair had worked to infiltrate Fortuna before Invidious lost his memories. Carmilla shared that she has a brief memory of Caspian being attacked and that it supports his murder by the vampires, but Zephyr also seemed perplexed as to why the vampires would be intent on stopping Caspian's mission in Fortuna. With all of this new information, Wolf was eager to enroll and pledged himself to continuing Caspian's search with the party as well as finding out what really happened to his father. Leaving the dining area, the group was introduced to more Order members including Breana, a pink cupid-black cat that grew immediately flustered upon seeing Xixy. Auden was also approached by an initiate named Gloom who said she recognized him and had something for him from Destiny. The party ended in the initiation room, where Wolf had convinced Zephyr to let them watch Therion's last trial but as they entered and sensed the magic happening Invidious recognized the trial for what it was - a face off with Despair's original creation, the thing all creatures should fear, the Void.
