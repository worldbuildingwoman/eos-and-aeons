## Summary

A realm of balance, Fortuna is governed by Fortune, the lady of luck. It is both good and bad fortune that finds its origin here and is then distributed throughout the [[Domain - Mundane]]. Thought to be a favorite of [[Destiny]], Fortune sits as a place of judgment for the creatures that pass on from this life and to the next. It is by her judgment, or that of her servants, that they find themselves in the next thread of their life. However, the realm of Fortuna can be incredibly fickle. One might find themselves on the path of good luck one moment only to have stumbled and ended up immobilized by ill fortune. For this reason, few visiting beings like to linger here. 

### The Jade Palace

The Aeon Fortune rules from this impressive palace of carved jade, with various omens of good luck carved into it. The surrounding city is where many of the Fortune [[Elves]] lives as well. 

### Four-Leaf Fields

The evergreen meadows of four-leaf clovers that are grown and harvested to transplant into the world as gifts of luck. It is also where you can catch a rainbow to Dream. 

### Hall of Numbers

An archive of fortune and judgment, the Hall of Numbers houses records of every culture and living thread and where their pasts are taking them. It is the record of which Fortune judges them when Time decides, and thus has a never-ending hall, which does in fact end, in Time. 

### The Shattering

A mirror realm of broken glass, its inadvisable to wander into this world without a known way out. Nearly as bad as the labyrinth, its easy to lose oneself in reflection and fall into Despair. 

### Raven's Wood

A forest of cawing corvids, clever to some and foreboding to others. Corvids are natural messengers for the Aeons and the elves and thus can pass between all realms.
