## Summary

We picked up with the party still split, focusing in on the floating market in Edith, where Morielle and Wolf were deep in their schemes of revenge and escape from the valkyrie bounty hunter and her automaton companion. However, things did not go quite as Morielle had hoped and as he reached for the necklace, found it no longer around Yelle's neck as the pair rounded on him, closing in and seeing through his disguise. A fight ensued, where Morielle and Wolf attempted to focus their hits on Yelle, doing a decent enough amount of damage before she and AuTee knocked them both out and took them to the Prosperity Casino, to turn them in. Here the pair sat unconscious for a day and a half before awakening in the lush office of the leprechaun casino boss who enlightened Morielle to the debt that put the bounty on his head. A whopping 100,000 gold - or a little less after he confiscated the money they'd pick-pocketed on the streets. Here, Morielle tried to persuade him to make a bet - double or nothing - as well as offering empty threats as to the state of his capture but the boss - or Ed as he said Invidious usually called him - seemed unphased. Even going so far as to let the devil know that his siblings barely blinked at the idea of a bounty on his head, making it clear that nobody would be getting retribution for Yelle's treatment of him. Instead, Ed offered Morielle a deal - find an artifact called the keycoin and his debt would be wiped clean. The only lead - it seemed Invidious was the prime suspect in its disappearance a year ago when Invidious was winning at a game and suddenly p and disappeared. Before the pair is set free, Ed put a tracking necklace around Morielle's neck and promised that if he did not return in a month, the chain would short to the point of decapitation and any additional attempts to tamper with it could result in the same. After this, the pair headed back to the Charmed Embrace where Enevra sent them back to Ennui, to the Soul Gardens, through Lussuria's private teleportation circle. It's here that Morielle meets his brothers for the first time and quickly realizes how much he still doesn't know - including the existence of a mortal woman and child whom he loved - and how shitty his family actually is. He leaves in a huff, angry and raging with Envy as the devil in him starts to come out. Meanwhile, on Team Emotions, Phinneas gets the best night of sleep in his life thanks to a familiar Dream elf who creates a peaceful escape from his usual nightmares. Bala and Phinneas have a discussion where she offers him some sage advice and gratitude for the party returning Dream to Reverie. She gifts him a flower that should help him find his way back here if he ever needs it, and the offer to just sit and be with him should he ever want company in his dreams. Alina woke up and waited for the group in the Final Meal, Carmilla headed out early to try and meet up with Marianne but found her shop closed and dark. A ghostly figure walked past, explaining "Isn't it sad. She hasn't been back in days..." before continuing on with his walk. She then headed to Blood and Ink to converse with Mr. Graves there who gives her a some details about the House of Ash but not much before she spots the family portrait and recognizes the dark features of Isabella - the vampire Xixy warned her about. Auden also tried to make a stop to the apothecarist and finds it closed, receiving the same ghostly message but additionally that Marianne left on her own. Returning to Xixy's, Auden talks about the need to get to the Crypt of Contrition, while also offering his own words of wisdom to the Black Cat who seems to have a very cynical outlook on life. They agree to check in with the rest of the party first and it is then that things start to come back together. Alina, Phinneas, Auden, and Xixy are contemplating their next steps when Wolf barges in with a wild story about their return. They start to head to the Soul Gardens where they find Carmilla on her way back and then eventually Morielle, who is acting not quite himself and rages with envy at the party before Phinneas is able to calm him down somewhat. It is here that the party decides that they must get out of the retched place that is Hell, and make quick plans to get to the Crypt of Contrition before trying to find a better lead for Morielle's new conundrum - return the keycoin or die in 40 days.
