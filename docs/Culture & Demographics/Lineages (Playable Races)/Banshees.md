*(Based on the Aasimar 5e.)*

A deathly scream is heard through the night, haunting and woesome. An undead spirit of a woman who faced a horrific death, their cries are a warning to others who might soon face the same fate. However well-intentioned, banshees are ultimately souls trapped in a world of the living as a figure of impending death. 

### History

 When the concept of mortality was introduced by the Aeons, it was [[Despair]] who saw the darkness in it. The tragedies that befell innocent beings at the randomness [[Fortune]] had suggested. In turn, Despair proposed that during their judgments, beings be given the choice to remember their deaths, so that they might not suffer the same fate again and warn others of the same thing. The other Aeons agreed and thus Orcaulum welcomed another creature of impending death: the banshees. However, caught up in the knowledge of their previous lives, the banshees are just as much a creature of Despair, and have found their way between Oraculum and Ennui rather easily. Time has even hinted that these beings might better serve Despair since they are not able to actually shepherd souls, just mourn them prior to their deaths. 

### Haunting & Sorrowful

While some might have thought that knowledge of a previous life would be a good thing, it has proved questionably so for the banshees. These haunting creatures are desperate to soothe their trauma as well as the sensations of isolation and loneliness that they face as undead spirits. They are quick to take up jobs and work wherever they are accepted but this willingness is in stark contrast to the inevitability that they will outlive the creatures they come to care for.
 
### In the Mundane
 
Banshees in the Mundane appear as very pale and sickly-looking humans. Some might even go as far as to say their appearance is more undead then when in the other domains. They have stark white hair and white eyes. To say they stand out, is an understatement.
 
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium 
**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
**Ability Score Increase:** When determining your character’s ability scores, increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1. Suggested increases are in Wisdom and Charisma. You can follow those suggestions or ignore them, but you can’t raise any of your scores above 20. 
**Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 
**Languages:** Death comes for all eventually, and you are still able to communicate with the living to continue your purpose. You know Common and one other language of your choice. 

**Caught on Death’s Doorway:** As a spirit caught between life and death, many of the things you once took for granted in your mortal coil now feel like foreign concepts to you. You no longer need to eat, drink, breathe or sleep, and magic cannot put you to sleep. While unable to truly rest in peace, you gain the benefits of a long rest by spending eight hours doing light activity. Finally, you are immune to effects of alcohol (note that this ability does not grant immunity to the effects of anything added to the alcohol, such as poison slipped into the drink). 

**Herald of Death:** As a herald of death, sending souls off with a horrifying sound has become an innate talent. You can cast the cantrip _Toll the Dead_ at will, using charisma or wisdom as your spellcasting ability. 

**Otherworldly Presence:** Being a messenger of death, most everyday people and creatures are unwelcoming and terrified of you. You gain proficiency in the intimidation skill. In addition to this, starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to turn your warning howls into a necrotic shroud. Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and your hair floats as if in water. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you that can see you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Until the transformation ends (1 minute or a bonus action to end it), once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.

**Geographic Distribution:** [[Domain - Ennui]]
